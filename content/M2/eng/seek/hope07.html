<h3>The Parable of the Lost Son</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Jesus continued: &ldquo;There was a man who had two sons.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>The younger one said to his father, &lsquo;Father, give me my share of the estate.&rsquo; So he divided his property between them.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;When he came to his senses, he said, &lsquo;How many of my father&rsquo;s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>So he got up and went to his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;The son said to him, &lsquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;But the father said to his servants, &lsquo;Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let&rsquo;s have a feast and celebrate.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.&rsquo; So they began to celebrate.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>&lsquo;Your brother has come,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>But he answered his father, &lsquo;Look! All these years I&rsquo;ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;&lsquo;My son,&rsquo; the father said, &lsquo;you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
