<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>Who has believed our message<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to whom has the arm of the <span class="small-caps">Lord been revealed?<br />
<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>He grew up before him like a tender shoot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and like a root out of dry ground.<br />
He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.<br />
<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>He was despised and rejected by mankind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.<br />
Like one from whom people hide their faces<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was despised, and we held him in low esteem.</span></p>
</div>

<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Surely he took up our pain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bore our suffering,<br />
yet we considered him punished by God,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stricken by him, and afflicted.<br />
<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>But he was pierced for our transgressions,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was crushed for our iniquities;<br />
the punishment that brought us peace was on him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by his wounds we are healed.<br />
<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>We all, like sheep, have gone astray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each of us has turned to our own way;<br />
and the <span class="small-caps">Lord has laid on him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the iniquity of us all.</span></p>
</div>

<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>He was oppressed and afflicted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet he did not open his mouth;<br />
he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as a sheep before its shearers is silent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so he did not open his mouth.<br />
<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>By oppression and judgment he was taken away.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet who of his generation protested?<br />
For he was cut off from the land of the living;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the transgression of my people he was punished.<br />
<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>He was assigned a grave with the wicked,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with the rich in his death,<br />
though he had done no violence,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor was any deceit in his mouth.</p>
</div>

<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Yet it was the <span class="small-caps">Lord&rsquo;s will to crush him and cause him to suffer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and though the <span class="small-caps">Lord makes his life an offering for sin,<br />
he will see his offspring and prolong his days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the will of the <span class="small-caps">Lord will prosper in his hand.<br />
<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>After he has suffered,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will see the light of life and be satisfied;<br />
by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will bear their iniquities.<br />
<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Therefore I will give him a portion among the great,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will divide the spoils with the strong,<br />
because he poured out his life unto death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and was numbered with the transgressors.<br />
For he bore the sin of many,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made intercession for the transgressors.</span></span></span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be warned, you rulers of the earth.<br />

<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Kiss his son, or he will be angry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your way will lead to your destruction,<br />
for his wrath can flare up in a moment.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed are all who take refuge in him.</span></p>
