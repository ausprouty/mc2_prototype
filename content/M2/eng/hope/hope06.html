<h3>Jesus Has Risen</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, &ldquo;Why do you look for the living among the dead?<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee:<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>&lsquo;The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.&rsquo; &rdquo;<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Then they remembered his words.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.</p>

<h3>On the Road to Emmaus</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them;<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>but they were kept from recognizing him.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>He asked them, &ldquo;What are you discussing together as you walk along?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stood still, their faces downcast.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, &ldquo;Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;What things?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About Jesus of Nazareth,&rdquo; they replied. &ldquo;He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Discuss the story together using:
	<ul>
		<li>What do we learn about Jesus?</li>
		<li>What do we learn about people?</li>
		<li>Who do you most identify with and why?</li>
		<li>Invite: Ask, &ldquo;What keeps you from following Jesus today?&rdquo;</li>
	</ul>

<h2>4. Practice:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Pair up and practice telling the story together</li>
