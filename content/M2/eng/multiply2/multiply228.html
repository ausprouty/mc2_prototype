<h3>Love for Enemies</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>Do to others as you would have them do to you.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that.<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.<sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.</p>

<h3>Judging Others</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.<sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>He also told them this parable: &ldquo;Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit?<sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother&rsquo;s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?<sup class="versenum">42&nbsp;</sup>How can you say to your brother, &lsquo;Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,&rsquo; when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<h3>A Tree and Its Fruit</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">43&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.<sup class="versenum">44&nbsp;</sup>Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers.<sup class="versenum">45&nbsp;</sup>A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.</p>

<h3>The Wise and Foolish Builders</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">46&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Why do you call me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; and do not do what I say?<sup class="versenum">47&nbsp;</sup>As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like.<sup class="versenum">48&nbsp;</sup>They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.<sup class="versenum">49&nbsp;</sup>But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="up">Jesus explains more about kingdom living to the disciples. Part of the plan for Kingdom expansion is to love others, even your enemies. It is a love that expects nothing in return. It is a radical, God-like love that will change the world. Part of loving others includes no longer judging other people and no longer condemning other people for their actions. Instead, extend forgiveness in Jesus&rsquo; name, not because they deserve it but because Jesus instructs us to forgive. We should take some time to examine our own lives. He instructs the leaders that &ldquo;the blind cannot lead the blind.&rdquo; Jesus expects the disciples to model this lifestyle. He reminds them that they need to watch His life and ministry closely. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Lord if you are not going to do what I say.&rdquo;</p>
