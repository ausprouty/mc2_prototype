<h3>Jesus Anointed by a Sinful Woman</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee&rsquo;s house and reclined at the table.<sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee&rsquo;s house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume.<sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, &ldquo;If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is&mdash;that she is a sinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered him, &ldquo;Simon, I have something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, teacher,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.<sup class="versenum">42&nbsp;</sup>Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">43&nbsp;</sup>Simon replied, &ldquo;I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have judged correctly,&rdquo; Jesus said.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">44&nbsp;</sup>Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, &ldquo;Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.<sup class="versenum">45&nbsp;</sup>You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.<sup class="versenum">46&nbsp;</sup>You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.<sup class="versenum">47&nbsp;</sup>Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven&mdash;as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">48&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Your sins are forgiven.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">49&nbsp;</sup>The other guests began to say among themselves, &ldquo;Who is this who even forgives sins?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">50&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said to the woman, &ldquo;Your faith has saved you; go in peace.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>The Parable of the Sower</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">8:1 </sup>After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out;<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod&rsquo;s household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.</p>

<p class="up">Jesus meets Simon, a curious Pharisee living in Capernaum, who had been following His ministry. Simon invites Jesus to his house along with many other Pharisees. Jesus accepts the invitation for the divine appointment arranged by the Father to reach out to these religious, self-righteous men. As the evening begins, Jesus is not offered the hospitality of washing, which is normally given to dinner guests. So the Father sent a sinful woman to do these things for Jesus. Jesus took the opportunity to teach the men about the heart of those who receive forgiveness: they are honest with their need and they are humble. Simon had learned how to cover up his sins. We need to be careful to live with integrity, accepting God&rsquo;s forgiveness for our sins and not hiding them like Simon.</p>
