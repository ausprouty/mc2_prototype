<p class="up">While the apostles were out on their ministry trips, King Herod Antipas was celebrating his birthday. He threw a big banquet and invited all the military commanders and upper-class people of Galilee to one of his palaces. He made a foolish promise to his niece because he liked the way she danced for the guests. Her mother, Herodias, seized the opportunity to get revenge on John the Baptist. She requested his beheading. Herod, not willing to lose face in front of his guests, did what Herodias asked and executed John. Meanwhile, Jesus was continuing His training and discipleship of others as He traveled from town to town (Matthew 11:1). News of John&rsquo;s death reached Jesus around the same time the Apostles were returning from their mission trips. Jesus was grieved over John&rsquo;s death and wanted to be with his closest leaders. They tried to find a place for a quiet retreat. He was modeling how to lead during times of grief and exhaustion.</p>
