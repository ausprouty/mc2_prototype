<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">After months of ministry training, the leaders are ready to be sent out on their own. Remember, they were appointed as leaders so that they might be with Jesus and that He might send them out to do the same things He had been doing. Jesus sent them out in teams of two. He gave them clear instructions on what to do, what to say, how long to stay, and how to respond when persecuted. He sent them out just like the Father had sent Him out into the world. They were to completely depend on God for everything that they would need. This short-term mission was within their own country, to people who were like them and spoke their language. They experienced being sent and doing ministry for the first time without Jesus being with them. What had been a single team of Jesus with the twelve apostles is now restructured to seven teams, six teams of two plus Jesus.</p>
