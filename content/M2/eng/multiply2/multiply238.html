<p><sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man&rsquo;s ears. Then he spit and touched the man&rsquo;s tongue.<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, <em>&ldquo;Ephphatha!&rdquo;</em> (which means &ldquo;Be opened!&rdquo;).<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>At this, the man&rsquo;s ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.<sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>People were overwhelmed with amazement. &ldquo;He has done everything well,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;He even makes t</p>

<h3>Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">8:1 </sup>During those days another large crowd gathered.

<p>&ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; they replied.</p>

When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people, and they did so.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>The people ate and were satisfied.

<p class="up">Jesus prioritized the training and development of His future movement leaders. He withdraws with them north to Tyre and Sidon, out of their country, and away from the pressures of ministry. Then they travel across and back down to the foreign territory of the Decapolis on the eastern side of Lake Galilee. This is the first visit to this area since the demon-possessed man was saved and sent back to share his story with family and friends. What a contrast to the previous visit when the people asked Jesus to go away! Now, as news about Him spreads, thousands gather to hear His teaching and experience His power in their own lives. They do not even go home to eat or sleep. After 3 days, Jesus involves His team in another learning experience of His great compassion for all people and His power to provide. They learn that the witness of one transformed life can open the door to entire groups of new people. As they participate in the miraculous feeding of over 4000 people they see Jesus&rsquo; compassion for all nations.</p>
