<h3>Jesus Clears the Temple Courts</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>In the temple courts he found people selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>To those who sold doves he said, &ldquo;Get these out of here!

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Jesus takes His disciples to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover. It was a seven-day festival to celebrate Israel&rsquo;s deliverance from Egypt under the leadership of Moses. We see Jesus&rsquo; passion for the Father&rsquo;s name and reputation. He was angry that the focus of the people had been taken off of worshipping the Father and onto taking advantage of people to make money. We see real human emotions here from a real human Jesus; we see real courage from a real divine Jesus. Jesus who was so in love with the Father that He could not stand by and see people make money from what God was offering as a free gift.</p>
