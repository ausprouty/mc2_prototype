<h3>Jesus Calls Levi and Eats With Sinners</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, &ldquo;Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered them, &ldquo;It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Jesus Questioned About Fasting</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>He told them this parable: &ldquo;No one tears a piece out of a new garment to patch an old one. Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.<sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.<sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.<sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, &lsquo;The old is better.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="up">Matthew was also a Jew known as Levi, son of Alphaeus. He was powerful, commissioned, trusted, wealthy and protected by Rome to collect taxes from the people of Israel. But as a tax collector, he was a traitor and hated by his own people. He lived in Capernaum. He had been watching Jesus and had heard about all He was doing. Maybe He had already been considering giving up everything to follow Jesus. Clearly the Father had been preparing his heart because he responded to Jesus&rsquo; call to follow Him. Immediately, Matthew introduced Jesus to his tax collector friends. In this sixth outreach, Jesus risked His reputation by spending time with this group of hated tax collectors. Jesus demonstrated His love as He modeled extending grace to hated people. Jesus loved being known as a friend of sinners.</p>
