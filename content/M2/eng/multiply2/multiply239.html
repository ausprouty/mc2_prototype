<h3>Peter Declares That Jesus Is the Messiah</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, &ldquo;Who do people say the Son of Man is?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>They replied, &ldquo;Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;But what about you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Who do you say I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Simon Peter answered, &ldquo;You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Jesus replied, &ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.</p>

<h3>Jesus Predicts His Death</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. &ldquo;Never, Lord!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This shall never happen to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Jesus turned and said to Peter, &ldquo;Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father&rsquo;s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="up">Jesus continues to prepare His leadership team for the mission. He is teaching them about love, humility, faith and their understanding of authority. He now takes them north to another non-Jewish, pagan area. Jesus begins to evaluate the ministry by asking &ldquo;Who do people say that I am?&rdquo; The question is about the core issue of the movement. It is the most important question we can ever ask ourselves and others. After almost three years of public ministry and showing signs that pointed to Him as Messiah, people still did not understand. Jesus then asked the Twelve how they would answer the question. Peter answered for the group, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the Living God&rdquo;. They got it! Jesus uses the opportunity to remind them that anything we understand about Jesus comes from the Father and not from our own intellect. This is also the first time Jesus mentions His &lsquo;Church&rsquo; which He promises to build upon the foundational truth of who He is. It was in that pagan territory that Jesus chose to first declare this plan. Imagine how different their understanding would have been had he made that same declaration in the Temple in Jerusalem!</p>
