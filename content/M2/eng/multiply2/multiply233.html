<h3>Jesus Restores a Demon-Possessed Man</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>He shouted at the top of his voice, &ldquo;What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God&rsquo;s name don&rsquo;t torture me!&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>For Jesus had said to him, &ldquo;Come out of this man, you impure spirit!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus asked him, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Legion,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;for we are many.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>The demons begged Jesus, &ldquo;Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man&mdash;and told about the pigs as well.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Jesus did not let him, but said, &ldquo;Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Jesus takes his leaders in training out of their comfort zone into the Gentile region of Decapolis, across the other side of the Lake. This was another country. This particular area is known for spiritual darkness because of a wild and violent demon-possessed man who terrorized the area. He lived in exile on the fringe of society among the tombs. On this &ldquo;foreign mission trip&rdquo; Jesus models to his leadership team His heart for all people, His mission to the whole world, and the reality that no one is beyond Jesus&rsquo; power to save. This demon-possessed man seems to be the main reason the Father led Jesus to make this trip. Not only is the man transformed, but he becomes a most unlikely person of peace sent to testify of Jesus to his family and friends. Jesus transforms the life of one person who in turn becomes the insider to share the Gospel into a whole new population.</p>
