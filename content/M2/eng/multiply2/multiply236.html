<h3>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias),<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the signs he had performed by healing the sick.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>The Jewish Passover Festival was near.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, &ldquo;Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Philip answered him, &ldquo;It would take more than half a year&rsquo;s wages to buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother, spoke up,<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said, &ldquo;Have the people sit down.&rdquo; There was plenty of grass in that place, and they sat down (about five thousand men were there).<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, &ldquo;Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>After the people saw the sign Jesus performed, they began to say, &ldquo;Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Without Jesus,Jesus was looking for a place to have a retreat with his leaders, but the Father had different plans. As they approached the shore, Jesus can already see the large crowds gathering because they saw the miracles Jesus had done. Jesus is moved with compassion for them because they looked like sheep without a shepherd. Jesus begins to teach the huge crowd of 5,000 men plus women and children. Jesus uses the situation to teach his leaders about multiplication and God&rsquo;s provision by challenging them to provide food for the crowd. They learned: 1) to lift up their eyes and see the need; 2) to allow their hearts to be moved to compassion; 3) to assemble the resources they have around them, including asking someone (the young boy) to give everything to see multiplication happen; 4) to organize and allow the supernatural to happen; and 5) to offer all they have to God in faith with thanksgiving.<br />
