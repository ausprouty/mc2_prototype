<h3>Paul and Silas in Prison</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, &ldquo;These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!&rdquo; At that moment the spirit left her.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>They brought them before the magistrates and said, &ldquo;These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone&rsquo;s chains came loose.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>But Paul shouted, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t harm yourself! We are all here!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>He then brought them out and asked, &ldquo;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>They replied, &ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved&mdash;you and your household.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized.<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God&mdash;he and his whole household.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: &ldquo;Release those men.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>The jailer told Paul, &ldquo;The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>But Paul said to the officers: &ldquo;They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed.<sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city.<sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia&rsquo;s house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them. Then they left.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">The ministry team of Paul, Silas, Timothy and Luke are in Philippi. Because there was no synagogue, they went to the place of prayer down by the river to look for others who had a spiritual interest. A demon possessed slave girl tried to associate with the team, but Paul knew from painful experience the danger of people thinking he was representing false religious practices (Acts 14:8-20). The power of Jesus overcame the demonic spirit and set the girl free. Because her owners could no longer use her to make money, they falsely accused Paul and Silas of introducing illegal customs which led to their arrest. Even in the midst of these difficult circumstances, Paul and Silas showed trust in the Lord as they worshipped Him in prison. In this case of persecution, the Lord did a miracle. As part of the Lord&rsquo;s miraculous work, the jailer was revealed to be a God prepared person of peace. The jailer and his whole household believed in Jesus. Before the team left, they encouraged the believers in the new church that was meeting in Lydia&#39;s house.</p>
