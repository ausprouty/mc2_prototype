<h3>Peter Explains His Actions</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>The apostles and the believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>and said, &ldquo;You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Starting from the beginning, Peter told them the whole story:<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles and birds.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Then I heard a voice telling me, &lsquo;Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I replied, &lsquo;Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;The voice spoke from heaven a second time, &lsquo;Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man&rsquo;s house.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, &lsquo;Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Then I remembered what the Lord had said: &lsquo;John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God&rsquo;s way?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, &ldquo;So then, even to Gentiles God has granted repentance that leads to life.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="collapsed" id ="Text2">


<p class="up">News spread quickly back to Jerusalem of the new work among the Gentiles. Peter returns home from his ministry tour (Acts 8:32) and is confronted by Jewish believers for breaking the Jewish Laws about entering a Gentile&rsquo;s home, eating with them, and even staying with them. Some believers still did not understand the implications of the gospel mission. They doubted the Lord&rsquo;s heart for the non-Jewish peoples. Jesus used this event to begin a process of breaking down their focus on their own culture that was a barrier to the global mission of making disciples of all peoples. It was the combination of the vision Peter received, the Lord&rsquo;s teaching, and evidence of the Holy Spirit&#39;s presence that proved God had indeed fully accepted the Gentiles. After hearing this, the Jewish believers finally praised God for providing salvation to the Gentiles. Their criticism and concern turned to worship.</p>
