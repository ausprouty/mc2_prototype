<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup><sup class="mid-paragraph versenum">1&nbsp;</sup>Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.</p>

<h3>On Cyprus</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their helper.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus,<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said,<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right!

<p>Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">The leadership team in the church at Antioch consisted of five men with different gifts and different backgrounds. The Spirit directed them to send out Saul and Barnabas, two members of the team, to make disciples and start new churches in new territories. Barnabas and Saul decided to take Barnabas&rsquo; young cousin, John Mark, with them as an assistant. The first place they visited was Barnabas&rsquo; home of Cyprus, an island off the coast of Syria. It was also believers from Cyprus that had help start the church in Antioch (Acts 11:20). These relationships likely influenced their plans. As a Roman citizen, Saul used his Gentile name, Paul, while he traveled. Paul and Barnabas are introduced to the governor of the island through a Jewish sorcerer which led to major spiritual conflict. Paul did not respond with fear but with the authority of Jesus (Matt 28:18-20) to overcome the demonic opposition. The conversion of the governor was another major milestone, it was the first time a Roman political ruler becomes a follower of Christ.</p>
