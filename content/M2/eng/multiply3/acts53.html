<h3>Paul Ashore on Malta</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, &ldquo;This man must be a murderer; for though he escaped from the sea, the goddess Justice has not allowed him to live.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead; but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>There was an estate nearby that belonged to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us to his home and showed us generous hospitality for three days.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>His father was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and, after prayer, placed his hands on him and healed him.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>When this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>They honored us in many ways; and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Read Romans 8:28-39. Even though in man&rsquo;s eyes this was an unplanned and unwanted stop, it was within God&rsquo;s sovereign plan. Regardless of the circumstances, Paul looked for the goodness and purpose of God. Through dependence on the Holy Spirit, he was intentional in relationships and obedient to Jesus&rsquo; Kingdom agenda as he ministered to those around him. The Lord even supernaturally protected Paul from a poisonous snake bite. The terrible disaster of the shipwreck turned out to be a blessing to the people of Malta, and the Lord received glory. Even on this remote island, Paul found a God-prepared person of peace, the chief official Publius. The home of Publius became a ministry center during the three months that they stayed on the island. Publius was so grateful that he supplied everything Paul, his companions and the soldiers needed to travel to Rome. The Lord not only saved the lives of those that were shipwrecked and those on the island, but He also restored all that was lost during the storm.</p>
