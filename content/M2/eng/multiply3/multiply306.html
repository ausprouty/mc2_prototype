<h3>Peter Heals a Lame Beggar</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer&mdash;at three in the afternoon.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, &ldquo;Look at us!&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Then Peter said, &ldquo;Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man&rsquo;s feet and ankles became strong.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>When all the people saw him walking and praising God,<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</p>

<h3>Peter Speaks to the Onlookers</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon&rsquo;s Colonnade.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>When Peter saw this, he said to them: &ldquo;Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus&rsquo; name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him, as you can all see.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Now, fellow Israelites, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Messiah would suffer.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord,<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>and that he may send the Messiah, who has been appointed for you&mdash;even Jesus.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>Heaven must receive him until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets.<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>For Moses said, &lsquo;The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from their people.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Indeed, beginning with Samuel, all the prophets who have spoken have foretold these days.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>And you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers. He said to Abraham, &lsquo;Through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed.&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">This is the first miracle Jesus does after his ascension. The disciples were continuing to live out His model of Holy Spirit power and dependence. Peter and John were going about their normal routine when this event took place. Jesus had taught them to give to whoever asked of them, (Matthew 5:42) and they had already experienced being used to heal others during their short-term mission trips (Matthew 10). Peter was quick to point out that the healing was the work of the resurrected, living and present Jesus. This miracle gave an opportunity for Peter and John to witness to all of the people in the temple courts. We need to be ready to obey the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s prompting in any circumstance.</p>
