<div class="bible">
<h3>In Corinth</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them,<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>But when they opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, &ldquo;Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: &ldquo;Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>So Paul stayed in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of Corinth made a united attack on Paul and brought him to the place of judgment.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;This man,&rdquo; they charged, &ldquo;is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to them, &ldquo;If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law&mdash;settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>So he drove them off.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Then the crowd there turned on Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the proconsul; and Gallio showed no concern whatever.</p>

<h3>Priscilla, Aquila and Apollos</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sisters and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchreae because of a vow he had taken.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>But as he left, he promised, &ldquo;I will come back if it is God&rsquo;s will.&rdquo; Then he set sail from Ephesus.<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>When he landed at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Corinth was a major economic city in the ancient world known for its immoral culture. When Paul arrived, he met Aquila and Priscilla, who had just come from Rome. They were like-minded business people who became a powerful husband-wife church planting team. Paul worked together with them in business and ministry. When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, they brought financial support and news of how the new believers in Thessalonica were doing (1 Thessalonians 3:2). Paul wrote both of his letters to the disciples in Thessalonica while he was church planting in Corinth. Paul faced a lot of social pressure and battled fears (Acts 18:9), but the Lord told him to keep going. Read 1 Corinthians 1:14-16. Large numbers of people came to faith in Jesus, yet in Paul&rsquo;s letter to the Corinthians we find out that Paul only baptized the first few believers. We learn the importance of empowering new believers for the mission of making disciples, baptizing and teaching them just as Jesus commanded.</p>
