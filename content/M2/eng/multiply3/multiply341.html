<h3>Through Macedonia and Greece</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, said goodbye and set out for Macedonia.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>He traveled through that area, speaking many words of encouragement to the people, and finally arrived in Greece,<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>where he stayed three months. Because some Jews had plotted against him just as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy also, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>But we sailed from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined the others at Troas, where we stayed seven days.</p>

<h3>Eutychus Raised From the Dead at Troas</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell to the ground from the third story and was picked up dead.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate.

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">As was his practice, Paul revisited the churches he started to encourage them and give them more teaching. He first went to Macedonia to visit the churches in the cities of Philippi, Thessalonica and Berea. During his stay, he wrote another letter to the Corinthians. After several months in Macedonia, Paul traveled to Achaia to visit the believers in Corinth. Before leaving for Jerusalem, he wrote a letter to the churches in Rome to let them know about his travel plans and to explain the gospel more deeply to them (Romans 1:11, 15:28). We see how Paul was always expanding his ministry team, developing leaders for the harvest from the harvest field. Seven people are mentioned who came from other movement centers. We learn from Paul&rsquo;s letters that he created unity among the different churches by collecting an offering to help the poor believers in Jerusalem (2 Corinthians 8:1-7, Romans 15:25-26). He linked leaders and churches together to help them see that they were part of a bigger movement (1 Thessalonians 1:14; 2 Thessalonians 1:4).</p>
