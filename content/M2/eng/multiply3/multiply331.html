Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,<sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the grace of the Lord.<sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</p>

<h3>Timothy Joins Paul and Silas</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">16:1 </sup>Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was Jewish and a believer but whose father was a Greek.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>The believers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.</p>

<div class="collapsed" id ="Text2">


<p class="up">Paul wanted to continue following his calling to bring about obedience to the faith among all peoples (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Romans%201:5"> Romans 1:5 </a>). As Paul and Barnabas prepared to leave, they had a big disagreement over Barnabas&rsquo; cousin John Mark. Paul did not trust that John Mark was up to the task because he had deserted them on the first journey. Barnabas saw John Mark&rsquo;s leadership potential and wanted to give him a second chance. As a result, Paul and Barnabas separated and formed two mission teams. Barnabas took John Mark and travelled back to Cyprus. Paul chose Silas, a prophet from the church in Jerusalem (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Acts%2015:32"> Acts 15:32 </a>), as a new partner and revisited the churches from the previous trip to Galatia. They strengthened the young churches and Paul also recruited a new believer in Lystra named Timothy to assist in the ministry. This story includes the fourth summary statement found in Acts: as a result of the team&rsquo;s encouragement and teaching, the churches grew stronger in faith and increased daily in numbers (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Acts%2016:5"> Acts 16:5 </a>).</p>
