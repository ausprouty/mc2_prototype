<h3>Peter Addresses the Crowd</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: &ldquo;Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It&rsquo;s only nine in the morning!<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the last days, God says,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pour out my Spirit on all people.<br />
Your sons and daughters will prophesy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your young men will see visions,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your old men will dream dreams.<br />
<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Even on my servants, both men and women,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pour out my Spirit in those days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will prophesy.<br />
<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>I will show wonders in the heavens above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and signs on the earth below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood and fire and billows of smoke.<br />
<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>The sun will be turned to darkness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the moon to blood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.<br />
<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>And everyone who calls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the name of the Lord will be saved.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>This man was handed over to you by God&rsquo;s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>David said about him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I saw the Lord always before me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is at my right hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be shaken.<br />
<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my body also will rest in hope,<br />
<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will not let your holy one see decay.<br />
<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>You have made known to me the paths of life;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will fill me with joy in your presence.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Fellow Israelites, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne.<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Lord said to my Lord:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sit at my right hand<br />
<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>until I make your enemies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a footstool for your feet.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, &ldquo;Brothers, what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>Peter replied, &ldquo;Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.<sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off&mdash;for all whom the Lord our God will call.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, &ldquo;Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Just weeks earlier, Jesus had opened the minds of the disciples to understand what scripture said about Him (Luke 24:44-49). Now, through the Spirit Peter was able to use scripture to interpret the recent events (Joel 2:28-32, Psalm 16:8-11, Psalm 110:1). Jewish pilgrims from every part of the Roman world heard the Gospel message of Jesus&rsquo; life, ministry, death, resurrection, and offer of salvation from sins. Peter pleaded with the crowd to repent from wrong attitudes and behaviors, and to identify with Jesus by being baptized in His name. He told the crowd the gospel message was not only for them but for their friends, family and everyone else too. The gospel message offers two free gifts: forgiveness of sins, which restores our relationship to God, and the Holy Spirit, who is God&rsquo;s indwelling presence. The community of disciples experienced explosive growth from about 120 to 3,000 in one day. Jesus is already helping to ensure the success of the Great Commission by saving people from all parts of the Roman world.</p>
