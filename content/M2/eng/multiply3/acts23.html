<h3>Peter&rsquo;s Miraculous Escape From Prison</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church, intending to persecute them.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>When he saw that this met with approval among the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. &ldquo;Quick, get up!&rdquo; he said, and the chains fell off Peter&rsquo;s wrists.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Then the angel said to him, &ldquo;Put on your clothes and sandals.&rdquo; And Peter did so. &ldquo;Wrap your cloak around you and follow me,&rdquo; the angel told him.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Then Peter came to himself and said, &ldquo;Now I know without a doubt that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod&rsquo;s clutches and from everything the Jewish people were hoping would happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>When this had dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer the door.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>When she recognized Peter&rsquo;s voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed, &ldquo;Peter is at the door!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of your mind,&rdquo; they told her. When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, &ldquo;It must be his angel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison. &ldquo;Tell James and the other brothers and sisters about this,&rdquo; he said, and then he left for another place.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him, he cross-examined the guards and ordered that they be executed.</p>

<h3>Herod&rsquo;s Death</h3>

<p>Then Herod went from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon; they now joined together and sought an audience with him. After securing the support of Blastus, a trusted personal servant of the king, they asked for peace, because they depended on the king&rsquo;s country for their food supply.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people.<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>They shouted, &ldquo;This is the voice of a god, not of a man.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.</p>

<h3>Barnabas and Saul Sent Off</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, also called Mark.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Jesus promised the Apostles, &ldquo;If they persecute Me, they will also persecute you.&rdquo; (John 15:20). This time persecution breaks out against the Apostles and other church leaders. The Lord allows the Apostle James to be killed, but He allows Peter to miraculously escape from Herod. Even though the believers were praying for the Lord to save Peter, some of them doubted it could happen (12:13). There is no common outcome to persecution: sometimes believers escape, sometimes they are killed; sometimes God does a miracle, sometimes He does not. The Lord taught &ldquo;love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you&rdquo; and &ldquo;vengeance is mine and I will repay&rdquo; (Matthew 5:43-48; Rom 12:17-21). At this time God responds to the arrogance and attack of Herod by removing him, while further spreading His own Word. This story includes the third summary statement found in the book of Acts: the word of God increased and multiplied (Acts 12:24).</p>
