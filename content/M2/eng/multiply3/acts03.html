<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Pentecost was one of the three main annual Jewish feasts and was attended by Jewish pilgrims from every part of the Roman world. It occurs 50 days after the Passover feast and is the anniversary of the Old Testament occasion of Moses receiving the Law from God (Exodus 20). 120 men and women were gathered together when the Spirit came. On the night Jesus was arrested, He taught the disciples that the coming Spirit would be another helper who would live in them (John 14:16-17). This new relationship with the Holy Spirit was promised hundreds of years earlier through prophets like Ezekiel. Read Ezekiel 36:26-27. The Spirit was sent to comfort, teach, lead, convict of sin, produce fruit, and empower the disciples to continue the work for which Jesus had trained them (John 14-15). It is through the presence and power of the Spirit that both men and women continue the mission of Jesus.</p>
