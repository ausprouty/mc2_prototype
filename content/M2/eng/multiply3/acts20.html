<p><sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>Then Peter began to speak: &ldquo;I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right.<sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.<sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached&mdash;<sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross,<sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen.<sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen&mdash;by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.<sup class="versenum">42&nbsp;</sup>He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead.<sup class="versenum">43&nbsp;</sup>All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">44&nbsp;</sup>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.<sup class="versenum">45&nbsp;</sup>The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles.<sup class="versenum">46&nbsp;</sup>For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God.</p>

They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">48&nbsp;</sup>So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">The Lord uses Peter to bring salvation to Cornelius and his household. This experience also teaches Peter, and the other Jewish believers with him, an important theological truth: the Lord accepts people from every nation and his offer of salvation is the same for all people. As reinforcement of this truth, the Gentiles experience the gift of the Holy Spirit in the same way that the Jews had at Pentecost (Acts 2:4; 10:47). Peter recognizes the Lord&rsquo;s acceptance of the non-Jewish people and commands that they immediately be baptized, just as they did with new Jewish believers. Peter stays several more days in a non-Jewish home to do immediate follow up with the new believers. Peter has now been part of seeing churches planted beyond all the cultural barriers that Jesus talked about (Acts 1:8): among the Jews in Jerusalem and Judea, among the Samaritans (Acts 8), and now among Gentiles (Acts 10). The doors to all the cultural boundaries are now unlocked for Kingdom expansion.</p>
