<h2>Scenario 1: Witnessing without holy living</h2>

<p>Someone in your coaching circle is leading 2 Multiply Groups.&nbsp; One group member is very active in ministry and always reports about talking with others about Jesus.&nbsp; However, he&nbsp; still is practicing bad habits.&nbsp; His lifestyle includes drinking and smoking, sometimes they even get drunk.&nbsp; Others in the Multiply Group have been discouraged by his actions and have begun to occasionally join him drinking.&nbsp; Which scriptures can you use to coach in this situation?</p>

<h2>Scenario 2: Not obeying what they were taught</h2>

<p>A member of your coaching circle has been leading a Multiply Group for over one year.&nbsp; Even though they were very active in prayer, care, share when they started, now things have cooled down.&nbsp; Over the past three months, members do not do their &ldquo;I will&rdquo; statements anymore.&nbsp; Some members have stopped coming.&nbsp; Which scriptures can you use to coach in this situation?</p>

<h2>Scenario 3: Come to Christ but not willing to work</h2>

<p>A member of your coaching circle is leading a young house church made up of students and young professionals.&nbsp; One student is in financial need and is often getting money from other members.&nbsp; He does not get a job because he says he is too busy with his school work.&nbsp; One day, he approaches the church about helping with his tuition bill.&nbsp; Which scriptures can you use to coach in this situation?</p>

<h2>Scenario 4: Muslim with several wives, wants to be a church leader</h2>

<p>A member of your coaching circle has a muslim background believer in their group.&nbsp; He came to Christ 8 months ago and his life has been radically changed.&nbsp; He is a faithful witness to other muslims and has led many to Christ.&nbsp; In fact, he is leading 2 Multiply Groups of his own and has shown leadership potential.&nbsp; However, he has two wives, both of whom have also accepted Christ.&nbsp; Which scriptures can you use to coach in this situation?</p>
