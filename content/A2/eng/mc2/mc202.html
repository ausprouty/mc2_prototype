<h2>Introducing the&nbsp; Five Phases of Jesus Ministry (20 minutes)</h2>

<p>Jesus gave us model of how to build multiplying faith communities and churches.&nbsp; During the coming months I encourage you to read the Gospels in chronological order. As you do this, you will see the logical progression of Jesus&#39; ministry and gain insights into what He did and what He valued during each phase.</p>

<h2>Phase 1: Preparation (20 minutes)</h2>

<div class="trainer-hide">

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>In this session we are going to focus on</p>
This period lasts from Jesus&rsquo; birth around 4 BC to about 30 years of age. This period is characterized by the following:<br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Becoming the person He sought to multiply in others</li>
	<li>Preparing for a godly life and a movement of multiplication</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
Over the first 30 years of His life, Jesus &ldquo;grew and became&rdquo; ( <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202:40,%2051-52&version=NIV">Luke 2:40, 51-52</a>) the Person He was going to multiply in others. All of this took place before His public ministry started. It was evident, from the beginning of His ministry, that Jesus had been praying, planning and clarifying what His ministry would be and how He would do it.</p>

<p>The passion of His heart was pure.</p>

<p>His purpose was clear.</p>

<p>The ministry process He decided on was simple:</p>

<ul>
	<li>He would connect with the lost,</li>
	<li>win them to Himself,</li>
	<li>build them in what it means to be a follower,</li>
	<li>train them in fishing for others and</li>
	<li>send them to multiply the same process with others.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
Jesus determined that He would seek out and work through the people His Father had prepared.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How does this relate to you and me?<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<button id="Button1" type="button" class="collapsible">

How does this relate to you and me?</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text1">

<p>Notice first that Jesus grew in &quot;wisdom and stature and in favour with God and man&quot;.&nbsp; As leaders our task of growing never stops.&nbsp; As God entrusts us with greater impact in the lives of others He expects growth in our character.&nbsp; In fact, God cares more about our character growth than the growth of our church or faith community.</p>

<p>We want to help with your character growth. Take a look at&nbsp;<a  target="_blank" href="https://app.mc2.online/content/A2/eng/develop/dev01.html"> the outline for our monthly gathering.</a> The first section each time we meet is the <em>Heart of a Leader: Evaluating our Walk with God</em></p>

<p>Five things were in place at the end of Jesus preparation years:</p>

<p>Purpose: What is our mission?</p>

<p>Passion: What is our motive?</p>

<p>Product: What does our Heavenly Father want to produce through us?</p>

<p>Process: What are the steps in becoming a maturing disciplemaker?</p>

<p>People: Who has the Father sent to prepare the way?</p>
