<h2>Phase 1: Preparation (20 minutes)</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="trainer-hide">

<p>This period lasts from Jesus&rsquo; birth around 4 BC to about 30 years of age. This period is characterized by the following:</p>
&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li>Becoming the person He sought to multiply in others</li>
	<li>Preparing for a godly life and a movement of multiplication</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the first 30 years of His life, Jesus &ldquo;grew and became&rdquo; (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Luke%202:40,%2051-52"> Luke 2:40, 51-52 </a>) the Person He was going to multiply in others. All of this took place before His public ministry started. It was evident, from the beginning of His ministry, that Jesus had been praying, planning and clarifying what His ministry would be and how He would do it.</p>

<p>The passion of His heart was pure.</p>

<p>His purpose was clear.</p>

<p>The ministry process He decided on was simple:</p>

<ul>
	<li>He would connect with the lost,</li>
	<li>win them to Himself,</li>
	<li>build them in what it means to be a follower,</li>
	<li>train them in fishing for others and</li>
	<li>send them to multiply the same process with others.</li>
</ul>

<p>Jesus determined that He would seek out and work through the people His Father had prepared.</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div id="Summary1" class="summary"><h2>+ How does this relate to you and me?</h2></div>
<div class="collapsed" id ="Text1">


<p>Notice first that Jesus grew in &quot;wisdom and stature and in favour with God and man&quot;.&nbsp; As leaders our task of growing never stops.&nbsp; As God entrusts us with greater impact in the lives of others He expects growth in our character.&nbsp; In fact, God cares more about our character growth than the growth of our church or faith community.</p>

<p>We want to help with your character growth. Take a look at&nbsp;<a  target="_blank" href="https://app.mc2.online/content/A2/eng/develop/dev01.html"> the outline for our monthly gathering.</a> The first section each time we meet is the <em>Heart of a Leader: Evaluating our Walk with God</em></p>
