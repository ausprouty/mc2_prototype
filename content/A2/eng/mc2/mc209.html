  <p>
    <p>One of Christ&rsquo;s unique priorities was to continually exalt His Father in every area of life. This was evident early in His ministry, as Jesus stated: &ldquo;But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God&rdquo; (John 3:21).</p>

<p><br />
Toward the end of His ministry, Jesus still acknowledged that everything He had came from the Father: &ldquo;Now they know that everything you have given me comes from You&rdquo; (John 17:7).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div id="Summary0" class="summary"><h2>+ Jesus exalted His Father throughout His ministry</h2></div>
<div class="collapsed" id ="Text0">


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself. He can only do what he sees his Father doing.</li>
	<li>By myself I can do nothing; I judge only what I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.</li>
	<li>For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.</li>
	<li>My teaching is not my own. It comes from him who sent me ... he who speaks on his own does so to gain honor for himself, but he who works for the honor of the one who sent him is a man of truth, there is nothing false about him.</li>
	<li>I do nothing on my own, but speak just what the Father has taught me.</li>
	<li>I have shown you many great miracles from the Father.</li>
	<li>For I did not speak on my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it ... I say just what the Father has told me to say.</li>
	<li>For everything I have learned from my Father, I have made known to you.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>Every part of Jesus&rsquo; life exalted the Father and His union with His Father. In the same way we are to exalt&nbsp; the Father in all that we do.</p>

<p>In Acts 2:42 the new church continued steadfastly in this priority as they devoted themselves to the &ldquo;breaking of bread&rdquo; &mdash; communion, remembering Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection and its impact on their lives.</p>

<p><br />
Biblical worship is exalting who God is, what He has done for us, and who we are in Christ. As we lift Him up, He will draw all men to Himself.</p>

<p>How can we train our people to exalt the Lord as a way of life, not just an event once a week?</p>
