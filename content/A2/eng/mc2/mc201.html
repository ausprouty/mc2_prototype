<h2>Allow 70 minutes for this session.</h2>

<h2>Setting the Tone (10 minutes)</h2>

<p>Need a greeting activity to help people feel comfortable and get to know one another.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to what God is going do to in and through our lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<h2>Goal: (10 minutes)</h2>

<p>MC2 is designed to help your team follow the model that Jesus used for establishing multiplying spiritual communities where a majority of the spiritual community are regularly:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Praying for the salvation of people in their social circles</li>
	<li>Deepening relationships by moving from casual to meaningful to spiritual conversations.</li>
	<li>Helping to meet the practical needs people in their social circles and wider community</li>
	<li>Sharing what God is doing in their life</li>
	<li>Praying with both Christians and non-Christians</li>
	<li>Reading the Bible with seekers</li>
	<li>Inviting groups of seekers to discover for themselves what it means to follow Jesus</li>
	<li>Helping to start new faith communities</li>
</ol>

<p>We will be learning together through:</p>

<ul>
	<li>group learning experiences and</li>
	<li>peer coaching</li>
</ul>

<p>With frequent evaluations and mid-source corrections</p>

<p>Celebrating what God does in and through people</p>

<p>Over the next 12 to 24 months</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<div class="trainer-hide">

<p>It is going to be a lot of work.&nbsp; There are going to be great joys and great sorrows along the way.&nbsp; Our hope is that you will draw closer to God and people during this time. That He will transform your character and increase your skill as you depend on him.</p>

<p>Many people start the journey.&nbsp; Those who continue and see it through have a firm conviction of why they started and what they want to see accomplished.</p>

<p>When Jesus&#39; disciples asked him to teach them to pray he said: &quot;This then is how you should pray: &#39;Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>What would it be like if all the people in your community God&#39;s will to be done on earth as it is in heaven?</p>

<p><span>Have participants get into groups of 3-4 people, to introduce themselves and discuss the following.&nbsp; They will return to the same groups for prayer at the end of this session.</span></p>

</div>

<h2>What is your vision? (15 minutes)</h2>

<p><span>Get into groups of 3-4 people, introduce yourselves and discuss the following: </span></p>

<p>What would it look like if all the people in your community wanted God&#39;s will to be done on earth as it is in heaven?</p>

<ul>
	<li>What would they be talking about?</li>
	<li>How would they dress?</li>
	<li>What would they spend their money on?</li>
	<li>What problems would disappear?</li>
	<li>What would people start doing? Stop doing?</li>
	<li>How would older people feel about the community?</li>
	<li>What would happen to crime?</li>
	<li>How would this impact hospitals?</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Gap (5 minutes)</h2>

<p>It would be wonderful if God&#39;s will was being done on earth as it is in heaven.&nbsp; But the reality is that there a lot of brokenness and suffering in our communities.&nbsp; Open the tab labeled &quot;The Gap&quot;.</p>

<div class="collapsed" id ="Text1">


<p><sup class="versenum">1:1 </sup>The words of Nehemiah son of Hakaliah:</p>

<p>In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa,<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>They said to me, &ldquo;Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Then I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="small-caps">Lord, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments,<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father&rsquo;s family, have committed against you.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses.</span></p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, &lsquo;If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations,<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was cupbearer to the king.</p>

</div>

<div class="trainer-hide">

<p><span>Have participants return to the same small groups as before and use Nehemiah 1 as their basis for prayer</span></p>

</div>

<h2>Pray (15 minutes)</h2>

<p>Return to your small group and pray using Nehemiah 1 as a prompt.</p>

<p>Write down anything God tells you during this prayer time.</p>

	<li>diagram</li>
</ul>

<p>Be prepared to share this the next time we get together.</p>

<p>2) Share with 5 friends about the gap you see and what you believe God wants you to do about it.&nbsp; Ask you friends to pray that you will be able to build a community that has the characteristics listed at the top of this page.</p>
