<h3>Paul the Roman Citizen</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, &ldquo;Rid the earth of him! He&rsquo;s not fit to live!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>the commander ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and interrogated in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, &ldquo;Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn&rsquo;t even been found guilty?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;This man is a Roman citizen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>The commander went to Paul and asked, &ldquo;Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>Then the commander said, &ldquo;I had to pay a lot of money for my citizenship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I was born a citizen,&rdquo; Paul replied.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>Those who were about to interrogate him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains.</p>

<h3>Paul Before the Sanhedrin</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>The commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews. So the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the members of the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">23:1 </sup>Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, &ldquo;My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Then Paul said to him, &ldquo;God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Those who were standing near Paul said, &ldquo;How dare you insult God&rsquo;s high priest!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Paul replied, &ldquo;Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest; for it is written: &lsquo;Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, &ldquo;My brothers, I am a Pharisee, descended from Pharisees. I stand on trial because of the hope of the resurrection of the dead.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>(The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees believe all these things.)</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. &ldquo;We find nothing wrong with this man,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, &ldquo;Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">As a Roman citizen, Paul was being protected by the commander, but he was still in great danger. The Roman commander displayed integrity by seeking to understand the situation and follow Roman civil law. The Jews were very zealous about their religious beliefs, willing to kill those who believed differently or, in their understanding, &ldquo;offended&rdquo; God. Paul took advantage of the theological differences among the Jewish leaders to shift the focus from himself onto to their theological disagreement. Jesus appeared to Paul to encourage him that He was working through him, in spite of the hostile response of the Jewish religious leaders. As we pursue the expansion of God&rsquo;s Kingdom, Jesus keeps his promise to &ldquo;never leave us nor forsake us.&rdquo; (Matthew 28:20). Read Ephesians 2:10. Like Paul, the Lord has created each of us for good works and He sovereignly uses all of our experiences to accomplish the works He has for us.</p>
