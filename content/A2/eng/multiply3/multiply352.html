<h3>The Shipwreck</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet deep.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow.<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, &ldquo;Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it drift away.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. &ldquo;For the last fourteen days,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t eaten anything.<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.<sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves.<sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>Altogether there were 276 of us on board.<sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could.<sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.<sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">42&nbsp;</sup>The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping.<sup class="versenum">43&nbsp;</sup>But the centurion wanted to spare Paul&rsquo;s life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.<sup class="versenum">44&nbsp;</sup>The rest were to get there on planks or on other pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land safely.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">The storm lasted over two exhausting and terrifying weeks! Paul insisted that the soldiers had to all to stay together in order for them to survive. They faced incredible danger, but Jesus was faithful to His promise and no one was harmed. Paul modeled trust in the faithfulness and goodness of God to all the non-believers and they were encouraged. This is a great example of valuing, praying for, and caring for all people regardless of their religion, race or position, just like Jesus did. The guards feared they would escape and wanted to execute all the prisoners but once again God worked through the favor of a Centurion to protect Paul.</p>
