<h3>Paul&rsquo;s Farewell to the Ephesian Elders</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot.<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>The next day we set sail from there and arrived off Chios. The day after that we crossed over to Samos, and on the following day arrived at Miletus.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>When they arrived, he said to them: &ldquo;You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>I served the Lord with great humility and with tears and in the midst of severe testing by the plots of my Jewish opponents.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>However, I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me&mdash;the task of testifying to the good news of God&rsquo;s grace.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of any of you.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God.<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them.<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>I have not coveted anyone&rsquo;s silver or gold or clothing.<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions.<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: &lsquo;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.<sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him.<sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">On his way to Jerusalem, Paul and the ministry team stopped in Miletus. Paul called the Ephesian elders to come so that he could speak to them one last time. From Paul&rsquo;s experiences we learn a lot about the perseverance it takes to plant churches in non-Christian cities. Paul faced many trials and hardships, but still told the Ephesians the truth. He did not change his message to please the people. Paul also modeled complete surrender to the Lord&rsquo;s will even in the midst of suffering. We also learn a lot about the important role that elders have. They are to guard their lives and be a model of how to walk with Jesus. They are also to guard God&rsquo;s people and feed them by teaching the Word. Jesus taught that the nature of the Kingdom of God would always include the presence of evil (Matthew 13:24-30). Paul knew they would face the dangers of false teachers whose desire was to destroy believers. This period ends with Paul stating that his work was done in the Eastern part of the Roman Empire (Roman 15:19).</p>
