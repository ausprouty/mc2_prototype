<div class="bible">
<h3>In Athens</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of them asked, &ldquo;What is this babbler trying to say?&rdquo; Others remarked, &ldquo;He seems to be advocating foreign gods.&rdquo; They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, &ldquo;May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we would like to know what they mean.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>(All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: &ldquo;People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: <span class="small-caps">to an unknown god. So you are ignorant of the very thing you worship&mdash;and this is what I am going to proclaim to you.</span></p>

<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us.<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>&lsquo;For in him we live and move and have our being.&rsquo; As some of your own poets have said, &lsquo;We are his offspring.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Therefore since we are God&rsquo;s offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone&mdash;an image made by human design and skill.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, &ldquo;We want to hear you again on this subject.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>At that, Paul left the Council.<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>Some of the people became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Paul had great compassion for the lostness of people and was saddened by the number of false gods the people tried to please. While he waited for Silas and Timothy to arrive from Macedonia, Paul continued to do evangelism with the different people in the Greek city of Athens: the small community of Jews in the local synagogue, the pagan general public in the market, and different types of educated philosophers (like university professors). This led to those people who were curious about the message to arrange a meeting with the city leaders. We see how Paul adapted his message for the audience of the Athenian leaders by starting from their context of having an &ldquo;unknown god&rdquo; and quoting one of their poets. Paul shows us that the way we communicate the gospel can be adjusted for different cultures while not changing the gospel message of needing to repent and believe in Jesus. Unlike other cities, there was very little response in Athens.</p>
