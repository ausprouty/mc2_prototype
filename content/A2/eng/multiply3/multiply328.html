<h3>In Lystra and Derbe</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>In Lystra there sat a man who was lame. He had been that way from birth and had never walked.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>and called out, &ldquo;Stand up on your feet!&rdquo; At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, &ldquo;The gods have come down to us in human form!&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting:<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Friends, why are you doing this? We too are only human, like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>In the past, he let all nations go their own way.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Unlike the other cities Paul and Barnabas visited, Lystra was a smaller, rural city that did not have a synagogue. The local people in Lystra still practiced their native religion and spoke their local language. Just as Jesus and Peter had healed the lame (Mt 15:30-31; Acts 3:1-10), Paul also responded to the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s prompting by healing a man lame from birth. Confusion followed as people interpreted the miracle through their own religion. They mistakenly concluded that Paul and Barnabas were gods, but there were some people who believed their message (Acts 14:20). Even after facing violent persecution, Paul boldly went back to the city to be with the new believers. Later Paul would write these words, &ldquo;everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted&rdquo; (2 Tim 3:12). They traveled to the next town, Derbe, where they also led many people to the Lord.</p>
