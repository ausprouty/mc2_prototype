<h2>New Lesson (45-60 minutes)</h2>

<h3><br />
&nbsp;</h3>

<p><strong>Relevant Topic: Why is it important that we know Jesus&rsquo; process for building a disciple-making movement and multiplying leaders for fulfilling the Great Commission?</strong></p>

<h3><br />
&nbsp;</h3>

<div id="Summary1" class="summary"><h2>+ Context</h2></div>
<div class="collapsed" id ="Text1">


<p class="flush">Jesus is our model for life and ministry. Because He is our model, it is important to know His character, His priorities, and His process for building a disciple-making movement. This movement multiplies others for fulfilling the Great Commission.</p>

<p class="flush">Christmas is the time we celebrate the mystery of The Word (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=John%201:1"> John 1:1 </a>). The Word became fully human (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=John%201:14"> John 1:14 </a>) born as a baby boy, Jesus of Nazareth. He came from eternity and entered into time and space. He entered a family, a culture, a village, a tribe and lived life one day at a time in first century Roman controlled Israel.</p>

<p class="flush">Though fully God, He chose to live His life as fully man, in total surrendered obedience to His heavenly Father. What He achieved in His life and ministry, He achieved as the man from Nazareth, the Son of Man, through the power and presence of the Holy Spirit in fulfilment of the Father&rsquo;s will. Though He had every right to operate out of his divinity, He chose to only live out of His perfect sinless humanity to be our example of how to fully glorify God in our life and ministry.</p>

<p class="flush">Jesus was and will always be fully God. Even though He had all the authority, power and resources of heaven at his command, He never used it. Instead He chose to &ldquo;become like his brothers in every way&rdquo; (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Hebrews%202:17"> Hebrews 2:17 </a>) but without sin. Because of this, the book of Hebrews encourages us, &ldquo;Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.&rdquo; (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Hebrews%203:1"> Hebrews 3:1 </a>)</p>

<p class="flush">The four Gospel writers record a summary of His life and teachings. By studying their written witness, we can learn about the development of His movement. In His humanity, even Jesus was subject to time and space and lived in the sequence of hours, days, weeks, years. He initiated and developed His movement in time. Therefore, Jesus case study is very instructive for leaders. We gain insight into how His life and movement unfolded over time by reconstructing a chronological sequence from the evidence provided by the Gospels.</p>

<p class="flush">Luke tells us that he sought to provide a well investigated and &ldquo;orderly account&rdquo; of Jesus life (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Luke%201:1-4"> Luke 1:1-4 </a>). The other writers were not concerned with order of events but arranged their accounts around themes. For example, John, the last of the four to write his gospel, recorded a lot of new material filling in some of the gaps in time especially the first year and a half (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=John%201-4"> John 1-4 </a>) and the last few weeks (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=John%2012-21"> John 12-21 </a>) of Jesus earthly life and ministry. In fact, John 13-20 covers just three days!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Gospel of Luke gives us some date markers so that we can locate Jesus in a historical context. Read <a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Luke%201:1-4"> Luke 1:1-4 </a>.</p>

<p class="flush">Luke tells us that Jesus was born during the reign of King Herod [the Great] (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Luke%201:5"> Luke 1:5 </a>), during the reign of Caesar Augustus (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Luke%202:1-7"> Luke 2:1-7 </a>) and while Quirinius was governor of Syria (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Luke%202:2"> Luke 2:2 </a>).&nbsp; He also states Jesus started his ministry during the 15th reign of Tiberius Caesar (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Luke%203:1-2"> Luke 3:1-2 </a>) and that Jesus was about 30 years old when he started (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Luke%203:21-23"> Luke 3:21-23 </a>). This is important because it helps us learn more about when and how long Jesus did his ministry. We can begin to see steps he took to lay a foundation for disciple-making, develop his followers into disciple-makers and over time equip proven disciple-makers to become multiplying movement leaders.</p>

</div>

<h3><br />
Activity 1: Group Competition/Game</h3>

<div class="trainer-hide">

<p>In small groups, try to arrange these events from the life of Jesus in the chronological order in which they occurred without using your Bible. &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Divide the participants into 4 groups. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Write the 21 events on Post It Notes. Write one event per Post It Note (DO NOT include any numbers), then put them in a random order. Give one set to each group.
	<ul>
		<li>Correct chronological order of the events in Jesus life and ministry:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Birth</li>
	<li>Return to live in Nazareth</li>
	<li>John the Baptist begins ministry</li>
	<li>Jesus&rsquo; baptism</li>
	<li>Temptation and 40 days fasting/prayer in wilderness</li>
	<li>Start of Jesus&rsquo; public ministry and first followers/disciples</li>
	<li>Jesus first meets Peter</li>
	<li>Jesus gains more disciples than John the Baptist</li>
	<li>Imprisonment of John the Baptist</li>
	<li>Samaritan woman at the well</li>
	<li>Jesus&rsquo; first rejection at Nazareth</li>
	<li>Jesus moves to live in Capernaum</li>

	<li>Jesus&rsquo; first declaration of his death and resurrection</li>
	<li>Sending out 72 others</li>
	<li>Crucifixion/Burial/Resurrection</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li>Give the groups 7 minutes (remember, no use of Bibles!)</li>
	<li>Compare answers showing uncertainties and assumptions. (DO NOT give the correct answer yet)</li>
	<li>Ask: What difference does it make in what order things occurred? How would it be helpful to understand that information of Jesus life and ministry?</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3>Activity 2: Chronological Overview of Jesus&rsquo; Ministry</h3>

<p>To make Jesus earthly ministry more understandable, we can make a chart and divide it into 5 chronological periods. Each period is focused on one main outcome. As we walk through this chart, you will see how a disciple-making movement developed from the very beginning when Jesus had no disciples to appointing leaders and sending them to multiply more disciples in more places. &nbsp;</p>

<div class="trainer-hide">

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Draw a Time Line on a white board or a large sheet of paper. Next, draw 5 dots on the line as show below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/content/A2/eng/develop/6-1.png" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Point out the scope of the framework by labelling the line: &nbsp;<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first dot. Ask:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What event marks the beginning? [His BIRTH]</li>
</ul>

<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The second dot. Ask:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What event marked the start of Jesus ministry? [His BAPTISM] &nbsp;</li>
	<li>How many disciples/followers did Jesus have before his Baptism? [NONE]</li>
	<li>What had he come to do, what was his purpose?</li>
	<li>[Through His death, He would be sacrificial lamb for the forgiveness of sin.</li>
	<li>But through His life, He showed us how to live and to launch a disciple-making movement that would continue beyond His earthly ministry.</li>
	<li>Think about it. He knew He was going to depart within a few short years.]</li>
</ul>

<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The last dot. Ask:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What did Jesus need to leave behind when He ascended? [A core group of multiplying disciples with the vision and process to fulfill the Great Commission.]</li>
	<li>
	<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Have someone read <a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=John%201:1-14"> John 1:1-14 </a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Pre-Incarnate glory, fully God, the WORD&mdash;<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=John%201:1"> John 1:1 </a>.
	<ul>
		<li>Draw semi-circle in the top left of diagram to represent this.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Incarnation: Fully God becomes Fully Man&mdash;<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=John%201:14"> John 1:14 </a>.
	<ul>
		<li>Draw arrow from semi-circle to timeline to Birth and add date of 4 BC.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Public Ministry
	<ul>
		<li>Label the second dot mid-26 AD, about 30 years after birth.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Death and Resurrection
	<ul>
		<li>Label the last dot 30 AD, about 3-4 years of ministry.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Post Ascension Glory&mdash;<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Acts%201:9"> Acts 1:9 </a>, <a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Acts%207:55"> Acts 7:55 </a>.
	<ul>
		<li>Draw a second semi-circle as shown</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The Diagram should look like this when done:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/content/A2/eng/develop/6-2.png" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To help us understand the progression of Jesus&rsquo; ministry, we have divided it into 5 periods the movement of disciple-makers grew (shown by a curved line). Add the 5 additional lines so that the diagram looks like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img alt="" src="/content/A2/eng/develop/6-3.png" /><br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Label the diagram as you describe each period:<br />
Period 1: Preparation<br />
Write Period 1: Preparation from birth of Jesus around 4 BC to about 30 years of age.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Summary: Becoming the person you seek to multiply, preparing for a Godly life and movement of multiplication.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Over the first 30 years of His life, Jesus &ldquo;grew and became&rdquo; the Product He sought to multiply in others. (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Luke%202:40"> Luke 2:40 </a>, <a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Luke%202:51-52"> Luke 2:51-52 </a>)</li>
	<li>His Passion was pure, His Purpose was clear, and</li>
	<li>The Process He decided on was simple. Jesus would connect with lost people, win them to Himself, and build them up in the faith. He trained them to fish for others and sent them to multiply that same process with others.</li>
	<li>Jesus determined He would seek out, work with and through the People His Father had prepared.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Diagram for Period 1 should look like this when complete:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/content/A2/eng/develop/6-4.png" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Period 2: Ministry Foundations<br />
Write Period 2: Ministry Foundations about 18-21 months in the second box.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Establishing a relational, God-centered foundation for making disciples.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
	<li>This period is marked from His Baptism by John in mid-AD 26 (about 30 years old) to the first rejection at Nazareth. A total of 18-21 months.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Jesus modelled the life of a disciple-maker by calling others to follow His example.</li>
	<li>He started with no disciples. As strange as it may seem, no one followed him from Nazareth until after His resurrection.</li>
	<li>Temptation/wilderness.</li>
	<li>His first contacts and first followers are from John&rsquo;s disciples. (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=John%201:35-51"> John 1:35-51 </a>)</li>
	<li>We can see Jesus modelling and laying a foundation of at least six clear priorities which make the English acrostic Holy Spirit P.O.W.E.R :</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent">Holy Spirit dependence<br />
P&mdash;Prayer<br />
O&mdash;Obedience to the Kingdom agenda<br />
W&mdash;the Word<br />
E&mdash;Exalting the Father<br />
R intentional Relationships</p>

<ul>
	<li>After 18 months, Jesus&rsquo; following and popularity outgrew John&rsquo;s. They both ministered mainly in Judea and Perea (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=John%204:1-4"> John 4:1-4 </a>). Notice what the Pharisees heard about Jesus&mdash;that He was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John. But it wasn&rsquo;t Jesus who did the baptizing. His disciples did. Just 18 months earlier, Jesus starts with zero disciples and now His following is accelerating.</li>
	<li>The period ends with John being imprisoned by Herod Antipas. (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Luke%203:19-20"> Luke 3:19-20 </a>; <a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Matthew%204:12"> Matthew 4:12 </a>; <a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Mark%201:14"> Mark 1:14 </a>; <a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Luke%204:14"> Luke 4:14 </a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The diagram for Period 2 should look like this when complete.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/content/A2/eng/develop/6-5.png" /><br />

Label the 3rd dot Call of the 4, Early 28 AD.</p>

<p>Summary: Periods 3 and 4 are happening simultaneously but represent two distinct periods. We see Jesus forming and training an expanding mission team as well as mobilizing for broader sowing and making new disciples. Jesus focused on a few and mobilized them for expanded mission. This period starts with Jesus&rsquo; move to Capernaum and His call of the four to be fishers of men in early 28 AD.</p>

<ul>
	<li>With John the Baptist&rsquo;s imprisonment, Jesus withdraws from Judea and travels north to Galilee. He returns to his hometown of Nazareth, is rejected, and relocates to a new home in Capernaum on the shores of the lake with a focused Kingdom message. (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Luke%204:14-31"> Luke 4:14-31 </a>; <a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Matthew%204:13-16"> Matthew 4:13-16 </a>; <a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Mark%201:14-15"> Mark 1:14-15 </a>) &nbsp;

	<ul>
		<li>Why did He go to Capernaum when he could have gone anywhere? It was the home town of a few key followers: Peter, Andrew, James and John (two sets of brothers in a partnership of family fishing businesses).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Jesus intentionally seeks out and challenges these four core disciples to increase their availability and commitment to be specifically trained to become &ldquo;fishers of men.&rdquo;(<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Mark%201:16-20"> Mark 1:16-20 </a>).
	<ul>
		<li>This is a strategic priority to focus on&mdash;building a core ministry team and equipping them to become disciple-makers.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Jesus models and equips his team through on-the-job training in the field and through expanded outreach. Immediately after their call to be &ldquo;fishers of men&rdquo; we have the record of at least 6 &ldquo;fishing&rdquo; expeditions. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Jesus conducts a tour around the whole region of Galilee with this team. Here are a few examples of how Jesus trained his initial team.

	<li>There begins to be exploding popularity accompanied by escalating conflict with religious leaders who begin plotting to kill Jesus.

Period 5: Leadership Multiplication<br />
Write Period 5: Leadership Multiplication, About 15 Months in the last box. Label the 4rd dot Appointing of 12 Apostles, Late 28 AD.</p>

<p>Summary:&nbsp; Period 5 lasts about 15 months from the appointing of the 12 Apostles to Jesus&rsquo; Ascension back to Heaven. The priorities were: selecting proven disciple makers, developing their leadership and sending them to continue the Father&rsquo;s Kingdom agenda and mission. We see Jesus appointing, training, handing over and releasing the movement to the next generation of multipliers.<br />
Here are some of the main activities of this period:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fall 28 AD&mdash;Appointment of the 12 Apostles. This was a strategic development of multiplication of leadership. Apostle means &ldquo;Sent One.&rdquo;
	<ul>
		<li>Have someone read Luke 6:12-16. As the passage unfolds, point out the different groups of people mentioned:</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Jesus</li>
	<li>The disciples</li>
	<li>12 appointed out of the disciples</li>
	<li>Another large crowd of disciples</li>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>They would be with Him (relationship)</li>
	<li>They were sent to preach (clear mission)</li>
	<li>They have authority to cast out demons (delegated authority)
	<ul>
		<li>While in prison, John hears of Jesus growing momentum. (<a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Matthew%2011:2-19"> Matthew 11:2-19 </a>)</li>
		<li>Jesus takes the 12 out on mission as a single well-resourced mission team</li>
		<li>Read <a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Luke%208:1-3"> Luke 8:1-3 </a>. Ask: &ldquo;Can you identify the emerging organizational structure of Jesus&rsquo; ministry?&rdquo;</li>
