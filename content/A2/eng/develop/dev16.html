<h2>Heart of a Leader: Evaluating our Walk with God (40 minutes)</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Worship together in the big group.</li>
	<li>Have participants get into groups of 3-4 people and discuss the following:
	<ul>
		<li>What are you learning about abiding in Christ? How are you practicing abiding through His Word, obedience, prayer-care-share, relationships and fellowship?</li>
		<li>Where in your life is it a challenge to obey God?</li>
		<li>What unresolved conflict do you have?</li>
		<li>What happened as you trusted God with your goals from our last meeting?</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Have each person set a goal of one thing they will work on in their walk with God.</li>

<p class="flush">We often struggle with a sense of worth and value and feel insecure in who we are. This is no less for leaders. In fact, sometimes our insecurities are magnified because of the added expectations on us.<br />
<br />
At the very beginning of Jesus&rsquo; public ministry, before He had made any disciples or performed any miracles and before He was known, Jesus was baptized. It was a simple act of obedience to His Heavenly Father&rsquo;s prompting. Something powerful followed that simple act. Luke records that Jesus was praying and as He prayed &ldquo;heaven openedand the Holy Spirit descended on Him in bodily form&rdquo; as a visible sign to others and the<br />
Father spoke. This is before any public ministry. What did the Father say? It is a powerful affirmation of identity and security in relationship with Him. &ldquo;You are my son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="flush">Being secure in knowing who we are flows from an understanding of whose we are.&nbsp; The love and pleasure of the Father are not based upon what we do and how we perform or what results we show but solely on our identity as His child. He knows us. He loves us unconditionally. He wants us to remember whose we are.</p>

Summary:</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text1">

<p>The Scriptures are God breathed &ndash; their source is from God. This is why we call the Scriptures God&rsquo;s Word. The Scriptures are God&rsquo;s Word and contain what we need to do every good work. Because of this, we deeply study God&rsquo;s Word.</p>

</div>

<h2>Activity 2: A Basic Bible Study Method</h2>

<button id="Button2" type="button" class="collapsible">


	Begin each time of study in the written word of God with prayer, asking the Holy Spirit (who is already within you) to help you understand God&rsquo;s truth in the passage you will read.
	After prayer, read a passage of Scripture. It is best to read a complete section. For example, a complete story or a complete teaching.
	Take a moment to understand the context of the passage. Look over the passages just before and just following your study passage.
	Now, to clearly understand the meaning of the Bible passage, ask yourself the following questions, in this order. If you like to write, you can write down your answers on a sheet a paper or in a notebook you keep for Bible study. This is especially helpful if you are studying an entire book passage by passage. The questions fall into four general categories. The first three are useful for personal Bible study, and the last category applies when you teach others or are studying a passage together as a group.
	
		Observation&mdash;What does it say?
		Interpretation&mdash;What does it mean?
		Application&mdash;What should I do?
		Teaching to others or Group Study&mdash;Sharing insights with one another.
	
	





Explain the different parts of Bible Study


&nbsp;</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text2">

<button id="Button3" type="button" class="collapsible">

Observation</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text3">

<p>This type of question first asks you to understand the facts of the passage. You must first know the details of the passage before you can accurately understand the meaning. Questions like these will help you clarify exactly what Scripture records. (You may not be able to answer each of the questions below for each passage you study.)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Who was involved?</li>
	<li>What happened?</li>
	<li>Where did this take place?</li>
	<li>When did it take place?</li>
	<li>Why did it happen?</li>
	<li>How are things accomplished?</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<button id="Button4" type="button" class="collapsible">

Interpretation</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text4">

<p>Once you know the facts of a passage, you must then seek to understand the intended meaning. The exact meaning of a passage is often obvious, but questions like these can ensure you discover Biblical truth. For very difficult teachings, these questions will also help you discover an acceptable&nbsp; interpretation to the passage. You may not be able to answer each of the questions below for each passage you study. Your goal is to be able to clearly say (or write out) in a few sentences the main spiritual truths contained in a passage.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What did it mean to the original audience?</li>
	<li>What are similarities and differences between this passage and our situation?</li>
	<li>What is the main idea?</li>
	<li>How does this passage relate to the rest of the book?</li>
	<li>What other Scripture passages might shed light on this one?</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<button id="Button5" type="button" class="collapsible">

Application</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text5">

<p>After determining the spiritual truths in a passage, you must ask, what am I to do now that I understand God&rsquo;s truth? How am I to apply these truths to my life? One passage may have many application points. The questions below can help you identify your response to God&rsquo;s word.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Is there a sin for me to avoid or confess?</li>
	<li>Is there a promise to claim? A praise to give? A prayer to pray?</li>
	<li>Is there an example for me to follow?</li>
	<li>Is there a command for me to obey?</li>
</ul>

<p>When believers identify sin to repent from, they will often need a plan on how to overcome that sin. Brothers and sisters can help them develop a plan, and even role-play situations they expect to encounter where they will face temptation. Such a plan includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When will we obey?</li>
	<li>When will it be difficult to obey?</li>
	<li>What will we do to obey?</li>
	<li>Where will we be when they obey?</li>
	<li>How often will we meet with a brother or sister for spiritual accountability?</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<button id="Button6" type="button" class="collapsible">

Teaching Others</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text6">

<p>Once you have applied the passage to your personal life, you can think how this passage would help others.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Who is someone who would be helped by something from this passage? When and how will you share it with them?</li>
	<li>When you gather as a group, is there something from this passage that would help or encourage your group?</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<button id="Button7" type="button" class="collapsible">

Group Study</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text7">

<p>When you are studying a passage together in a group, you can use the questions below as a discussion format. These questions will replace the more in-depth questions you ask yourself in a private Bible study. However, it is best to prepare for group study by first studying a passage privately using the method discussed above. Someone should be picked to lead in asking the questions, but everyone in the fellowship should respond as God leads them. Often, there is no right or wrong answer to these questions; rather, they are designed to start conversations within your group about God&rsquo;s truth contained in the passage, so you can learn from one another. When discussed with a Godly attitude, the result will be mutual&nbsp; encouragement, closer Christian relationships, and greater knowledge of God and His ways.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What is this passage about? What is the main idea of the passage?</li>
	<li>What do we learn about God from this passage?</li>
	<li>What is the most interesting part of this passage to you?</li>
	<li>How is this passage relevant for today?</li>
	<li>What do we have to do in order to obey the intention of this passage?</li>
	<li>With whom will you share this story or truth?</li>
</ul>

Summary</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text8">

<p>Discipleship is not merely knowledge. There is a knowledge component, but it is primarily patterns and processes to practice and pass on. As much is taught by example as by content. The methods and principles of Bible study, the patterns of prayer life and worship, and the encouragement, fellowship, support and equipping of the Body are all being learned as the leaders model these behaviors. A leader&rsquo;s attitude of servanthood, humility, urgency, faith, passion for extending God&rsquo;s Kingdom, and love for fellow believers and the lost are vital aspects of this approach.<br />
These aspects of discipleship are caught more than taught.</p>

<p>Four parts of Studying the Bible:</p>
