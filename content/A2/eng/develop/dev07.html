Motivation and Encouragement</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text0">

<p>What do you fear? Fear is common to all people. It is one of the effects that sin had on the original relationship man had with God. We are all impacted by fear and suffer from the lack of peace it brings. Fear can motivate us to do bad things or to make bad decisions. Jesus reveals that His heart is gentle and humble ( <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2011:29&version=NIV">Matthew 11:29</a>). He invites us into His presence, where we can experience His love for us that cast out fears ( <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:18&version=NIV">1 John 4:18</a>). On the night of His betrayal and eve of his crucifixion, Jesus said to His disciples, &ldquo;Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.&rdquo; ( <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:27&version=NIV">John 14:27</a>). In light of who He is and what He has done for us, we need to choose peace and courage despite our circumstances and &ldquo;not let our hearts be troubled.&rdquo; Faith is deciding to trust God and take obedient action despite our feelings of fear. Let His words to Israel be comfort you, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, for I am with you. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you. I will hold you up with my victorious right hand.&rdquo; ( <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2041:10&version=NIV">Isaiah 41:10</a>)</p>

<h2>Group Celebration of Faithfulness (20 minutes)</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Celebrate Faithfulness in the large group so that all can benefit and be encouraged. Give opportunity for participants to share what has happened since the last meeting. Ask them to relate it to goals they set from the last meeting.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Have everyone return to their Iron-on-Iron small groups, draw their network of missional communities and churches, and then share and evaluate with their group.

		<li>What is going well?</li>
		<li>What is not going well? What obstacles are you facing?</li>
		<li>What are possible solutions from the other group members?</li>
		<li>What do you need to do to add the missing characteristics into each group?</li>

	</li>
	<li>Have everyone set goals for improvement from their evaluation and share their goals with the small group. Then have them pray for one another.</li>

<p class="flush">At first Jesus tested them with a small request (come and see, stay with me today) but they did not follow him full-time. Jesus later tested their commitment at the seashore (use your boat, let down your nets by faith). They then began to spend uninterrupted time with Jesus. Finally, Jesus selected the 12 out of many disciples to develop as leaders.</p>

<p class="flush"><strong>Important Principles</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent">The 3/3 Discipleship Training Process is a good way to give small assignments and see who is faithful. You can also begin allowing group members to begin leading parts of the 3/3 Discipleship Process.</li>

	<li class="indent">The best leaders are developed on the job (accountability, practice and setting goals).</li>

<h2>Activity 2: Jesus&rsquo; Selection of Leaders</h2>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> We will look at Paul&rsquo;s instructions to Titus, one of the leaders he developed. After Paul was released from prison (end of  <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2028&version=NIV">Acts 28</a>), he began his missionary work again. Along the way, he went to Crete and started several churches with Titus. After he left Crete, he wrote a letter back to Titus with instructions on choosing leaders from among the new believers for the new churches.</p>

Summary:</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text2">

<p class="indent">Have someone read  <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%201:10-12&version=NIV">Titus 1:10-12</a> . Notice that these new converts in Crete came from an immoral, corrupt background. Even an ancient historian named Polybius wrote &ldquo;It is almost impossible to find personal conduct more treacherous or public policy more unjust than in Crete.&rdquo; In this context, Paul told Titus to appoint new leaders! Paul told Titus to look for changing character over skill and to appoint multiple leaders for each church. The primary skill to look for was how they handled the Word. Young leaders are not perfect! But their lives are changing! Here is a story to illustrate (or use your own):</p>

<p class="indent2">In one Asian country, church planters are working to see a movement of churches in an unreached province of their country. There was a high school principal who came to faith. Before he became a believer, he used to drink a lot and had many adulterous relationships. But Jesus radically changed his life and he began to witness to many people. He was able to start seven new house churches and became an effective leader.</p>

<p class="indent2">One day there was a leadership training in the city. After he finished, he was driving home on his motor bike and decided to spend the night in a small town along the way.&nbsp; He met a woman and slept with her. The next day he felt very bad because of his sin. He wept and wept. It took many weeks for his relationship with his wife to be fixed. And not only that, the new churches he was leading were impacted and he ended up losing most of them. But after several months of being restored, he began serving the Lord again and now has 20 new house churches in his network. He has proven to be an effective leader.</p>

<p class="indent">New leaders will make mistakes, and some will need to be disciplined because of their sin. But so did the disciples and so did the young leaders that Paul appointed as elders.</p>
