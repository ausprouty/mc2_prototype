<h2>Heart of a Leader: Evaluating our Walk with God (40 minutes)</h2>

<p>Worship together in the big group.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Have participants get into groups of 3-4 people and discuss the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What are you learning about abiding in Christ? How are you practicing abiding through His Word, obedience, prayer-care-share, relationships and fellowship?</li>
	<li>Where in your life is it a challenge to obey God?</li>
	<li>What unresolved conflict do you have?</li>
	<li>What happened as you trusted God with your goals from our last meeting?</li>
</ul>

<p>Have each person set a goal of one thing they will work on in their walk with God.</p>

<p class="flush">Read  <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209:28-31&version=NIV">Luke 9:28-31</a> .</p>

<p class="flush">Friendship and loving support of others is an essential component in the long and challenging journey of following Jesus. Without the encouragement, support and accountability of others, we are far more vulnerable to spiritual attack and discouragement. Even strong, gifted, deeply spiritual leaders need to build around them the support of an inner circle of close friends.</p>

<p class="flush">Jesus modelled this for us. In the midst of all the crowds who followed, all the disciples who listened and served with Him, He invested deeply into the twelve and even more so into three of that close circle, Peter, James and John. In  <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209:28-31&version=NIV">Luke 9:28-31</a>  we see that three were invited to share in the high point of His transfiguration and again in  <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2014:32-36&version=NIV">Mark 14:32-36</a>  we see the same three were invited to go further with Jesus to share in the<br />
darkest, hardest hour as He prayed in the garden before His betrayal.</p>

<p class="flush">Read  <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2014:32-36&version=NIV">Mark 14:32-36</a> .</p>

<p class="flush">Jesus deliberately took His closest friends with Him to share the experience of His highest and lowest moments, His joys and His fears, struggles and victories. He wanted and needed their support, prayer and encouragement. In the garden of his tears He said &ldquo;My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death...stay here<br />
and keep watch with me.&rdquo; Strong leaders know their need for others and cultivate their inner circle of &lsquo;garden friends&rsquo;. Who are your &lsquo;garden friends&rsquo; and what can you do to grow them further?</p>

</div>

<h2>Group Celebration of Faithfulness (20 minutes)</h2>

<p>Celebrate Faithfulness in the large group so that all can benefit and be encouraged. Give opportunity for participants to share what has happened since the last meeting. Ask them to relate it to goals they set from the last meeting.</p>

<h2>Evaluating Ministry and Movement Health (45 minutes)</h2>

<p>Have everyone return to their Iron-on-Iron small groups, draw their network of missional communities and churches, and then share and evaluate with their group.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What is going well?</li>
	<li>What is not going well? What obstacles are you facing?</li>
	<li>What are possible solutions from the other group members?</li>
	<li>What do you need to do to add the missing characteristics into each group?</li>
</ul>

<p>Have everyone set goals for improvement from their evaluation and share their goals with the small group. Then have them pray for one another.</p>

Summary</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text1">

<p class="flush">The lawyer asked Jesus a question, &ldquo;Who is my neighbor?&rdquo; Jesus turned the question around and answered, &ldquo;Who are you a neighbor to?&rdquo; We have been practicing Prayer, Care, Share because we believe it reflects God&#39;s desire that people experience the tangible love of God through us. Most of the time we think about applying Care with individuals we want to lead to Christ. That is a<br />
good desire. However, the example of the Good Samaritan shows us that we may need to take even greater steps to show God&#39;s love and impact our communities.</p>

<p class="flush">As new groups and churches are added, our care and love for the community can take an even broader form. We can begin to help with issues that impact the entire community.</p>
