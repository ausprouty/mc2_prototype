<p>Each time we meet we will use a peer mentoring process called Iron-on-Iron.&nbsp; This comes from  <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2027:17&version=NIV">Proverbs 27:17</a>  &ldquo;As iron sharpens iron, one man sharpens another.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Heart of a Leader: Evaluating our Walk with God (40 minutes)</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Worship together in the big group.</li>
	<li>Have participants get into groups of 3-4 people and discuss the following:
	<ul>
		<li>What are you learning about abiding in Christ? How are you practicing abiding through His Word, obedience, prayer-care-share, relationships and fellowship?</li>
		<li>Where in your life is it a challenge to obey God?</li>
		<li>What unresolved conflict do you have?</li>
		<li>What happened as you trusted God with your goals from our last meeting?</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Have each person set a goal of one thing they will work on in their walk with God.</li>
</ul>

Motivation and Encouragement</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text0">

<p><em>Timothy was one of the next generation leaders that Paul had developed. Timothy was faithful but he still needed encouragement from Paul to &ldquo;train yourself to be godly&rdquo; embracing the disciplines of a disciple and the responsibilities of spiritual leadership. Here are wise words for Timothy and for us as we lead others to follow Christ and fish for men.

<h2>Group Celebration of Faithfulness (20 minutes)</h2>

<p>Celebrate Faithfulness in the large group so that all can benefit and be encouraged. Give opportunity for participants to share what has happened since the last meeting. Ask them to relate it to goals they set from the last meeting.</p>

<h2>Evaluating Ministry and Movement Health (45 minutes)</h2>

<div class="trainer-hide">

<ul>
	<li>Provide instructions on how to do Gen Mapping (use a white board or on a large sheet of paper so everyone can see the demonstration.)
	<ul>
		<li>Have each person draw a circle with dotted lines to represent their discipleship group.</li>
		<li>Above the circle, have them put 3 numbers: # of people in group, # of people who are believers, # who are baptized. For example: 12 / 9 / 7</li>
		<li>Add the location, the date the group was started and the name of the leader if there has been one appointed.</li>

<ol class="indent">
	<li>Prayer (draw a symbol of someone praying or write &ldquo;PR&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>Worship (draw a music note or write &ldquo;WP&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>Studying the Word (draw a book or write &ldquo;WD&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>Witness/Prayer, Care, Share (draw a symbol of seeds or write &ldquo;WIT&rdquo; or &ldquo;PCS&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>Fellowship (draw a heart or write &ldquo;F&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>Baptism (draw a symbol of water or write &ldquo;B&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>Giving (draw a symbol of money or write &ldquo;G&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>Lord&rsquo;s Supper (draw a cup or write &ldquo;LS&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>Leaders (draw a shepherd or smiley face or write &ldquo;LD&rdquo;)</li>
</ol>

<ul class="indent">
	<li>Have them evaluate their group. If the group is practicing that characteristic, then have them write that word or symbol inside the circle. If the group is not practicing that characteristic have them write the symbol outside the circle.</li>

<h2>New Lesson (45 minutes)</h2>

<h3>Activity 1: Review 3/3 Discipleship Meeting</h3>

<p class="flush">The Three-Thirds Process is very powerful. It helps lay a foundation for becoming an Acts 2 community and encourages multiplication. The different components of the Three-Thirds Process all contribute in different ways. Here is how the process works.</p>

<div class="trainer-hide">

<ul>
	<li class="indent">Draw the Three-Thirds (3/3) Discipleship Process as follows using only a black marker.</li>
</ul>
NOTE: The colors will be added later.

<ul>
	<li>Ask in the large group:
	<ul>
		<li>What parts are focused internally, helping a group grow as healthy followers of Jesus?</li>
		<li>What parts are focused externally, helping a group multiply?</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>After discussing as a large group:
	<ul>
		<li>Identify the Internally Focused parts by circling or starring with a GREEN marker: Care, Worship, New Lesson, Praying for the Mission.</li>
		<li>Identify the Externally Focused parts by circling or starring with a RED marker: Celebration of Faithfulness (Accountability), Vision Casing, Preparing for the Mission (Practice), Going on the Mission (Setting Goals) &nbsp;</li>
		<li>Point out that the GREEN parts are more like a traditional Bible study, they are important for growth and health. The 4 RED parts contribute to multiplication. If you are short on time, give priority to the RED parts.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
</div>


<p class="flush">Review the purpose of the Multiply Lessons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Lessons 1-7 are focused on walking with God</li>
	<li>Lessons 8-12 are the ministry skills you are learning in this Launch Training</li>
	<li>Lesson 13-16 are introducing the practices of the Acts 2 communities</li>
</ul>

<h3>Activity 2: Tips for Leading 3/3 Discipleship</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<button id="Button2" type="button" class="collapsible">

Tips

Review the tips below to engage more fruitfully in the Care section of Looking Back and to lead effectively in the Looking Up Discovery discussions.</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text2">

<h4>Caring for One Another Tips (Looking Back)</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Monitor your time.</li>
	<li>If someone has a need or issue that needs additional attention, ask them to stay after the meeting to talk further.</li>
	<li>Seek to provide wise, Biblical counsel without becoming their counselor. Encourage the group to offer helpful suggestions and meet practical needs.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Discovery Discussion Tips (Looking Up)</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Involve everyone in the discussion:
	<ul>
		<li>Have everyone in the group answer the first question: What did you like best?&nbsp; Why?</li>
		<li>Have someone who just answered a question call on someone else in the group to continue the discussion by answering the question.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>To keep from error:
	<ul>
		<li>Ask what verse they got their idea from.</li>
		<li>Ask the group what they think about what was said.</li>
		<li>Have the group hold each accountable to retell the story accurately&mdash;(Read, Tell, Correct).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Do use the Bible stories.</li>
	<li>Do only talk 25% and let your group talk 75%.</li>
	<li>Do let the Holy Spirit work through the group discussion.</li>
	<li>Do facilitate the group through asking questions.</li>
	<li>Do have fun!</li>
	<li>Do Not talk about politics or religion, either good or bad.</li>
	<li>Do Not change topics or pursue other interesting topics.</li>
	<li>Do Not dominate the conversation. Let everyone participate</li>
	<li>Do Not over explain. It is hard to avoid explaining Scripture when we work with new believers. We need to show them Scripture is the authority and not ourselves. If we are the authority, then multiplication is limited by our leadership and our time to teach every group. We must allow the Holy Spirit to use His Word in their hearts.</li>
	<li>Do give a summary of the discussion at the end.</li>
	<li>Remember, watch your time!&nbsp; You want to leave plenty of time for Preparing for the Mission and Going on the Mission.</li>
	<li>NOTE: If you want to discuss the topic more, you can repeat the lesson the following week. You do not have to use a new topic every week you meet.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2>Preparing for Mission: Evaluating our Leadership (20 minutes)</h2>

<p>Have everyone find a partner:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Draw the Three-Thirds Discipleship Process (3/3) and identify the four parts for multiplication.</li>
	<li>Review the Caring for One Another Tips and the Discovery Discussion Tips.&nbsp; Have each participant Evaluate their strengths and weaknesses in leading the 3/3 Discipleship process and Make a Plan on how they will improve</li>
	<li>Write &ldquo;I will, by when&rdquo; statements.</li>
</ul>


    <div class="note-div">
        <form class = "auto_submit_item">
            Notes: (click outside box to save)<br>
            <textarea  onchange= "addNote()"  id ="note4Text" rows="5"></textarea>
        </form>
    </div>

<ul>
	<li>NOTE:&nbsp; It is helpful to assign one another partners so that each participant will have a partner they can connect with, pray with, and encourage in between the Develop meetings.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sending the Laborers</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Reinforce the overall vision&mdash;a church or faith community for every 1,000 people.</li>
	<li>Spend time in prayer:
	<ul>
		<li>committing the goals that were set to the Lord.</li>
		<li>for God to raise up a movement of churches.</li>
		<li>for more laborers to come out of the harvest.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
