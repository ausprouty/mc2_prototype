<h2>Heart of a Leader: Evaluating our Walk with God (40 minutes)</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Worship together in the big group.</li>
	<li>Have participants get into groups of 3-4 people and discuss the following:
	<ul>
		<li>What are you learning about abiding in Christ? How are you practicing abiding through His Word, obedience, prayer-care-share, relationships and fellowship?</li>
		<li>Where in your life is it a challenge to obey God?</li>
		<li>What unresolved conflict do you have?</li>
		<li>What happened as you trusted God with your goals from our last meeting?</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Have each person set a goal of one thing they will work on in their walk with God.</li>
</ul>

<p class="flush">There are often times when there are so many things demanding our attention that we get worried and distracted. When that pressure takes over, we can lose our joy. Jesus and his disciples were visiting in the home of Mary and her older sister Martha. It was a big deal, a very special occasion. Both sisters were excited and aware of the significance of the occasion, but they responded very differently.</p>

<p class="flush">Martha was driven by her desire to serve well by being the perfect host, doing all she could to honor and bless Jesus through her hard work. Mary, on the other hand, was driven by her desire to listen, learn and receive every blessing she could from Jesus. In frustration at her sister, Martha asked Jesus to direct Mary to come and help. Jesus affirmed Mary&rsquo;s priority above hers.</p>

<p class="flush">We must never let our motivation of doing ministry for Jesus get in the way of personal time with him. Both are important, but first and foremost is the need to sit at his feet listening to him and avoid becoming worried and distracted by all the good work. Guarding this priority requires constant discipline helped by accountability. How do you maintain your priority of sitting at Jesus feet listening to his words?</p>

Summary</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text1">

<p>Jesus Christ had been with his disciples for a long time. Jesus taught them with wisdom from Heaven and performed miracles and incredible signs. Toward the end of His ministry in the world, He told His followers that He would be given over to evil people who would kill Him. But three days later, He would be raised to life again. Indeed all these things happened just as He said they would. After Jesus rose again, He revealed that all of the things He did and that happened to Him were written in the Old Testament Scriptures (none of the New Testament letters were written at that time). There are still more prophecies like these which show the majesty of Christ.</p>

</div>

<h2>Activity 2: Old Testament Survey</h2>

<p class="indent">The whole Bible is about the reign of God over what He created. God and His Kingdom are without beginning and without end. He will always be the King of the Universe and therefore God is your King. You are His subject, a citizen in His Kingdom. Regardless of your ethnic background, culture or birth place, your highest commitment belongs to the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p class="indent">The Bible is divided into two parts: 39 books are included in the Old Testament (or Old Covenant) and 27 books are in the New Testament (or New Covenant).</p>

<p class="indent">The Old Testament is comprised of four kinds of books:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Law</li>
	<li>History</li>
	<li>Wisdom</li>
	<li>The Prophets</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent">Knowing which type of book we are reading is helpful for understanding the book&rsquo;s meaning.</p>

<p class="indent">The Old Testament is a report about God&rsquo;s revelation of Himself to mankind, especially to the Israelites. The Old Testament teaches us about God and how to live in His will. It was written over a period of 1,000 years when the prophets and certain other holy people received words from God by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">In other words, it was the Holy Spirit who wrote God&rsquo;s Word. Although the Word was penned by men, it was the Holy Spirit who conveyed the message to God&rsquo;s people. Perhaps you have already heard about people such as the prophet Moses. Moses wrote the first five books of the Old Testament.</p>

<p class="flush">&nbsp;</p>

<button id="Button2" type="button" class="collapsible">

Law </button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text2">

<p class="indent">First five books of the Bible written by the prophet Moses. These books are called The Law. The Law was given to the nation of Israel through the prophet Moses. Laws from this part contain the procedures for Israel&rsquo;s religious ceremonies. These five books also contain ethical and moral laws related to everyday life in the nation of Israel.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Read aloud together the names of the books of the Law: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<button id="Button3" type="button" class="collapsible">

History</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text3">

<p class="indent">The section following the Law in the Old Testament tells the history of God&rsquo;s people, the Israelites. Both the positive parts and the negative parts are included in the history. That is why both the nation&rsquo;s successes and failures were written. The history books note what actually happened, not what would hopefully happen. The good and the bad was recorded in order to teach us ( <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2010:11&version=NIV">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>). Events in these books are often used as examples in other parts of Scripture. The purpose of the history books is to show God&rsquo;s purposes for His people as related to the history of the world.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Read aloud together the names of the books of History: Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<ul>
</ul>

<p class="flush">&nbsp;</p>

<button id="Button4" type="button" class="collapsible">

Books of Wisdom and The Psalms</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text4">

<p class="indent">The first book of Wisdom is Job, which tells how Job was befallen by many tragedies, however his faith remained strong. Finally, Job was healed and his life was restored.</p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent">Read aloud  <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%202:9-10&version=NIV">Job 2:9-10</a> .</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent">The second book of Wisdom is Psalms. Much of the Psalms were written by King David, although some were written by the prophet Moses and other authors. The book of Psalms contains 150 psalms (songs or verses) &ndash; praises and struggles sung to God by His people. Further, the book of Psalms contains prayers of God&rsquo;s people lifted to Him during both public and private worship. Psalms usually were written to be sung. The Psalms are used by God&rsquo;s people for worship, devotions, and examples of how to live.</p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent">Read aloud  <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%201&version=NIV">Psalm 1</a> ,  <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2023&version=NIV">Psalm 23</a>  and <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=%20&version=NIV"> </a>  <a class="bible-ref"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20150&version=NIV">Psalm 150</a>  to illustrate their use among God&rsquo;s people.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent">The Wisdom of King Solomon is included in the book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Song of Solomon. Proverbs contains short verses about how to live&nbsp; righteously before God. Ecclesiastes is the story of King Solomon&rsquo;s efforts to find happiness. Song of Solomon is a story of love between a husband and a wife.</p>

<p class="indent">Generally, advice in the books of Wisdom is not commanded yet it gives principles for practical living. Usually, the Wisdom books are heart-felt&nbsp; expressions to God from people just as they are. Finally, there is a way out of life&rsquo;s problems through an attitude of the heart that fears God and obeys His commands. Proverbs and advice presented in the Wisdom books are things to remember, so they were written in the form of short phrases. Although there is no guarantee of prosperity in life, instruction from the Wisdom books teaches life principles in accordance with the will of God.</p>

The Prophets</button><div class="collapsed" id ="Text5">

<p class="indent">The prophetic books have two purposes: to call God&rsquo;s people back to the covenant they had made with Him and to reveal God&rsquo;s plan for&nbsp; redemption in the coming Messiah. The prophets made utterances in the name of the LORD to mankind at that time. All prophets spoke and applied their messages that were given from God. So, to understand the meaning of their messages and prophecies, the reader must know the problem that was being addressed by the prophet. Only then could the reader know how to apply the prophet&rsquo;s message properly today.</p>

<p class="indent">The books of the prophets are separated into two sections: the &ldquo;Major Prophets&rdquo; are longer and the &lsquo;Minor Prophets&rsquo; are equally important, but they are called Minor they were shorter in length.</p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent">Read aloud together the names of the Major Prophets: Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Daniel.</li>
	<li class="indent">Read aloud together the names of the Minor Prophets: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</li>
