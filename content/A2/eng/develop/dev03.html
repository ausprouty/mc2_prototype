<h2>Pre-session requirement by you, as the facilitator, or your trainer:</h2>

<p>Please discuss how the pastor of your church wants to handle Baptism and Communion in the new groups that are being formed. Who can do it? How it will be done? When will it be done? Below is an example of what to say:</p>

<p class="indent"><em>&ldquo;Pastor, we are excited about what the Lord is doing through you and your church. Your participants in this training have been working hard for the last 2 months. They have finished the initial training and have a missional community. As they disciple the new believers and teach them to obey Jesus, they learn about topics that are precious to the church: two of these topics are Baptism and Communion. We want to introduce these two important topics and put them into practice. On these two subjects, we want your direction on how best to proceed. Please review the lesson (have a copy for him/her) and give us direction on how the new believers can apply them. Our desire is for this to be as meaningful to these new Christians as possible and consistent with your desires. How can we and your participants in the training proceed?&rdquo;</em></p>

	<ul>
		<li>What are you learning about abiding in Christ? How are you practicing abiding through His Word, obedience, prayer-care-share, relationships and fellowship?</li>
		<li>Where in your life is it a challenge to obey God?</li>
		<li>What unresolved conflict do you have?</li>
		<li>What happened as you trusted God with your goals from our last meeting?</li>
	</ul>

	<li>Set a goal of one thing you will work on in your walk with God.</li>

<p><em>Peter was one of the closest followers of Jesus. He experienced many miracles and experienced the thrill of the Lord using him to reach many people. But he also made many mistakes as a young leader. He often took action and said things before thinking. He lied about being a follower of Jesus. And he got discouraged. But Peter was always honest with Jesus. There is so much we can learn about having a heart and love for the Lord from the life of Peter. We all can relate to stumbling as we learn to be leaders. But be encouraged. Jesus is full of grace and He is gentle in His heart toward us. He will patiently guide you and teach you along the way.</em></p>

<p>A famous Chinese pastor, Watchmen Nee, said &ldquo;Baptism is the outward expression of an inward faith.&rdquo; Baptism is an obedience issue. In <a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Matthew%203:13"> Matthew 3:13 </a>, Jesus modeled Baptism for us. And in <a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Matthew%2028:19"> Matthew 28:19 </a>, He commanded His followers to baptize others. It does not mean every sin in our lives is gone before we obey. Baptism is not about being mature; it is about being sure we want to commit our lives to being followers of Christ. Even though every example in Acts people were baptized immediately, there is not a direct command to be immediately baptized.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important that someone understand what Baptism represents before they are baptized. However, we should be careful not to hinder people from obeying God by being baptized immediately after they believe.</p>

<p>The death and resurrection of Jesus were so significant that the Lord gave us two ordinances to practice so we can identify ourselves with them. Baptism is done once and symbolizes our commitment to identify with Jesus&rsquo; death and resurrection. The Lord&rsquo;s Supper, or Communion, is done on a regular basis and reminds us of the New Covenant we have with God because of Jesus&rsquo; death and resurrection. Teaching new believers about Baptism is found in Foundational Bible Study 4: Boldly Identifying with Jesus. Teaching new believers about Communion comes in Foundational Bible Study 14: Remembering Jesus&rsquo; Sacrifice.</p>
