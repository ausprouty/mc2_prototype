<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p>Read Hebrews 10:19-25. The Lord did not call us to be alone. He called us to be together. We face many challenges and we need encouragement and accountability to obey the Lord. Following Jesus is best done in community. We need each other so let&rsquo;s not quit meeting together!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>God gave the Jews a special celebration called the Passover to remember how He delivered them from slavery in Egypt. The night before Jesus died on the cross, He celebrated the Passover with His disciples and explained how the Passover pointed to Him.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="bible"><sup>14&nbsp;</sup>When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>And he said to them, &ldquo;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.&rdquo;

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, &ldquo;Take this and divide it among you.<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Jesus modelled to His followers a way to remember His sacrificial death on the cross. [Take a piece of bread] The bread represents His body that was broken for us. [Show them wine or juice] The drink represents His blood that was shed for us and opened a new way to relate to God. He also commanded them to keep practicing it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="up">In 1 Corinthians 11:23-30, we see that as Paul started new churches, he taught all new believers how to obey Jesus&rsquo; command.&nbsp;</p>
