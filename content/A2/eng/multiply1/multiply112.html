<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p>In the book of Acts, we see how believers trained others to be trainers of others. One of the first followers of Jesus was a man named Barnabas. He found a new believer named Paul and helped him. Paul found a young believer named Timothy and took Timothy with him to share the gospel in many places. Later, Paul wrote to Timothy that he should train faithful men in the churches to find other younger Christians to train. Read 2 Timothy 2:2. Jesus to Barnabas to Paul to Timothy to faithful men to other younger Christians. All Christians are called to train trainers who can train trainers to train others. In this way the gospel spreads rapidly!</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p>To follow Jesus means that we will obey His command to be His witnesses. But we can only do what is needed with the help of the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives. Only as He empowers us, can we be effective witnesses. God&rsquo;s desire is that we witness to everyone--those like us and those not like us; those near to us and those who live all over the world.</p>

<p>For further enrichment: Read Transferable Concept #5: How you can be a fruitful witness and discuss with another group member.</p>

<p><strong>BEFORE I ACCEPTED CHRIST</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>What was my life like that will relate most to the non-Christian?</li>
	<li>What did my life revolve around the most? What did I get my security or happiness from? (The non-Christian is relying on something external to give them happiness)</li>
	<li>How did those areas begin to let me down?</li>
	<li>What is one word that captures this feeling? For example: empty, lost, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HOW I ACCEPTED CHRIST</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>What was my reaction when I first heard about Jesus?</li>
	<li>When did my attitude about Jesus begin to turn around? Why?</li>
	<li>What is one word that captures this feeling/change? For example: grace, amazed, etc?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOW I HAVE ACCEPTED CHRIST</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>What specific changes have taken place in your life since giving control of your life to Jesus?</li>
