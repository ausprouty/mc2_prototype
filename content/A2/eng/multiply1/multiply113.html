<p>Since everyone is called to follow Jesus and fish for men, we should realize there are only two kinds of people in the world-- lost and saved. Lost people need to follow Jesus. Saved people need to learn to fish for the lost. When you see the world as two types of people, then your daily interactions get much simpler. If you meet a lost person, witness to them. If you meet a saved person, offer to train them. It can&rsquo;t get much easier than that!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>Read <a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Acts%2010:1-8"> Acts 10:1-8 </a>. Peter was directed by the Spirit to go to a seaside town called Caesarea where a Roman military leader named Cornelius lived. He was a God- prepared Person of Peace. Peter obeyed and traveled to Caesarea to tell Cornelius about Jesus. Let&rsquo;s see what happens.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<p>Read or <a  target="_blank" href="https://api.arclight.org/videoPlayerUrl?refId=2_529-Acts7328-0-0">watch</a> <strong>Acts 10:24-35</strong> two times as everyone listens</p>

<div class="bible_container">
<div class="bible">
<div class="bible"><sup>24&nbsp;</sup>The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>But Peter made him get up. &ldquo;Stand up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am only a man myself.&rdquo;

<p><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>While talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people.<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>He said to them: &ldquo;You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should not call anyone impure or unclean.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Cornelius answered: &ldquo;Three days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>and said, &lsquo;Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>Then Peter began to speak: &ldquo;I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right.</p>
