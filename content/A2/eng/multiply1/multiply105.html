<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p>As Jesus went through all the towns and villages, he saw the needs of the people and had compassion on them. He said to his disciples, &quot;The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.&quot; God wants all people to know him and his love. He wants to use us and He will also raise up more workers from the harvest we will reap. Let&rsquo;s keep asking God to send more workers to lead people to know Him.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>Even though Jesus was busy in ministry, he spent a lot of time talking to the Father. As his followers watched him, they too wanted to learn how to talk to the Father. Today we will learn what he told them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<p>Read or <a  target="_blank" href="https://api.arclight.org/videoPlayerUrl?refId=6_529-GOLukeEnglish6030">watch</a><strong> Luke 11:1-13</strong>&nbsp;two times as everyone listens</p>

<div class="bible_container">
<div class="bible">
<div class="bible"><sup class="versenum">1&nbsp;</sup>One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, &ldquo;Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.&rdquo;

<p><sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>He said to them, &ldquo;When you pray, say:</p>

<div class="poetry top-05">
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Father,<br />
hallowed be your name,<br />
your kingdom come.<br />
<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Give us each day our daily bread.<br />
<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Forgive us our sins,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.<br />
And lead us not into temptation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, &lsquo;Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer him.&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>And suppose the one inside answers, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can&rsquo;t get up and give you anything.&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity he will surely get up and give you as much as you need.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prayer is simply talking to our heavenly Father. We can use these four points to summarize what Jesus taught:&nbsp;</p>

	<li>Acknowledge your sins;&nbsp;</li>

<h2 class="forward">Hearing God&#39;s Voice</h2>

<p class="forward">&ldquo;His sheep follow him because they know his voice.&rdquo; - John 10:4b</p>

<ul>
	<li class="forward">What are some ways that God speaks to us? What have you experienced?</li>
	<li class="forward">Discuss this as a group.</li>
</ul>

<p class="forward">When God speaks it is always from love, with truth, goodness, brings life, releases peace, and gives hope. It is always anchored to the Word of God, and reflective of the character and nature of Jesus. When we speak it should reflect how God speaks.</p>

<ul>
	<li class="forward">Pair up with someone. Read <a class="bible-ref external-link"  target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSG&search=Galatians%205:22-23"> Galatians 5:22-23 </a> and ask the Holy Spirit to highlight a spiritual fruit that He wants to affirm in their life. &nbsp;Share what you have heard from God and thank Him for that fruit in their life.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="forward">Go back to your daisy and ask Jesus who to focus on in daily prayer, practical care, and love over the next week. When a name stands out to you, circle it. You can pray, &ldquo;How do you see them Father? What do you want to say to them or do for them?&rdquo; If you have an idea, scripture, picture, or practical action comes to mind for a someone on your daisy, write that next to their name.</li>
