We cannot control Him or make Him move; He blows where He wills. We cannot create movements, only the Spirit of God can. But we can position ourselves so that when He does move, we are ready to move with Him. The simple skills you&rsquo;ve been learning help do just that.

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>Paul had been arrested because he was falsely accused by the Jewish leaders of breaking a temple law. During his defence before the Governor, Paul shared the story of how he came to know Christ.</p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<p>Read or <a  target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/162982206">watch</a> <strong>Acts 22:1-21 </strong> two times as everyone listens</p>

<div class="bible_container">
<div class="bible">
<div class="bible"><sup>2&nbsp;</sup>When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very quiet.

<p>Then Paul said:<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I studied under Gamaliel and was thoroughly trained in the law of our ancestors. I was just as zealous for God as any of you are today.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison,<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>as the high priest and all the Council can themselves testify. I even obtained letters from them to their associates in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, &lsquo;Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who are you, Lord?&rsquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,&rsquo; he replied.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>My companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;&lsquo;What shall I do, Lord?&rsquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Get up,&rsquo; the Lord said, &lsquo;and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.&rsquo;<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there.<sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>He stood beside me and said, &lsquo;Brother Saul, receive your sight!&rsquo; And at that very moment I was able to see him.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Then he said: &lsquo;The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>You will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard.<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance<sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>and saw the Lord speaking to me. &lsquo;Quick!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Leave Jerusalem immediately, because the people here will not accept your testimony about me.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;these people know that I went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you.<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.&rsquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Then the Lord said to me, &lsquo;Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p class="up">Paul&rsquo;s story (testimony) can be summarized in 3 parts:</p>

<div class="collapsed" id ="Text1">


<p class="forward">What others expect me to believe is not relevant in our postmodern culture. However, anything that I have experienced is relevant.</p>

<p class="forward">Sharing your personal experiences is a key way for people to get to know Jesus. It is best to keep your story short (max. 30 seconds). Short stories are easy to listen to and easy to incorporate into everyday conversations.</p>

<p class="forward">Take context into account: Share stories that have something in common with the listener&rsquo;s experiences and which they will find easy to identify with. Telling a father about how God helped you in your relationship to your children will communicate better than if you tell the same story to a teenager who doesn&rsquo;t have kids. An athlete, who&rsquo;s been dogged by injury, will find stories about God healing physically especially relevant.</p>

<p class="forward">Share your feelings: Your friends will find it easier to follow your story if you talk about your feelings.</p>

<p class="forward">For example: &ldquo;I was really scared of an exam. I&rsquo;d often failed and had blackouts during past exams. Last week I spoke with a friend and we prayed to Jesus to calm my heart. As we prayed, I felt such a peace that I went to the exam with a completely different outlook. I don&rsquo;t know what my grade is, but I was able to remember everything and felt really calm. It was amazing!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="forward">Be honest, real and personal: It&rsquo;s not about impressing your listeners. You can be honest about your weaknesses and difficulties. People know that we&rsquo;re not perfect, but we want to tell them that we&rsquo;ve got a great God who is our friend. Your listener will find it easier to be honest, if you&rsquo;re open about your difficulties.</p>

<p class="forward">For example: &ldquo;I was driving the other day and someone cut me off. I got really angry. I took a breath and asked Jesus to help me calm down. Instead of driving aggressively, I calmed down, and was able to let it go.&rdquo;</p>
