<p>God loves people! The Bible tells us God&rsquo;s desire is that all people are saved and come to understand the truth (1 Timothy 2:4). The gospel is not only for you but for all your friends and family. God loves them and will use you to pass on what you are learning about Jesus so that they can follow Jesus also. As we journey together, it will be exciting to see what God will do in the lives of those around us.</p>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>Jesus was teaching that he is the good shepherd who lays down his life for his sheep (v 11). He also said, &ldquo;I know my sheep and my sheep know me,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and have it to the full.&rdquo; However, many of the Jews don&rsquo;t believe him, and doubt His claims. This is where our story begins.</p>

<h2 class="up">Read&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Read or <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.jesusfilm.org/watch/life-of-jesus-gospel-of-john.html/the-good-shepherd/english.html">watch</a><strong> John 10:22-30</strong> two times as everyone listens</p>

<div id="bible">
<div class="bible">
<div class="bible"><sup>22&nbsp;</sup>Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon&rsquo;s Colonnade.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, &ldquo;How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.&rdquo;

<p><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Jesus answered, &ldquo;I did tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father&rsquo;s name testify about me,<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>but you do not believe because you are not my sheep.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.<sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father&rsquo;s hand.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>I and the Father are one.&rdquo;</p>
