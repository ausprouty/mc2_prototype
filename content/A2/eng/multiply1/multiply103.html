<h2 class="back">Motivation and Encouragement</h2>

<p>One day a woman went to visit her neighbour. As they were talking, she shared the gospel with her neighbour and her neighbour placed her faith in Christ. But then the woman started crying. &ldquo;My husband just died two weeks ago. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me this sooner?&rdquo; You see, we never know when people&rsquo;s last day will be. That&rsquo;s why we must share the gospel when we have the chance.&nbsp;.</p>

<div class="lesson-section up">LOOK UP</div>
</div>

<h2 class="up">Context</h2>

<p>When we place our faith in Jesus, God&rsquo;s Spirit begins to live inside of us. He is called the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth and our Helper. His ministry in our lives is so important that we will take time to study our relationship with Him.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="up">Read</h2>

<p>Read or watch <strong>1 Corinthians 2:14-3:3</strong> two times as everyone listens</p>

<div id="bible">
<div class="bible"><sup>14&nbsp;</sup>The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments,<sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>for,

<p>&ldquo;Who has known the mind of the Lord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so as to instruct him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But we have the mind of Christ.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">3:1&nbsp;</sup>Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly&mdash;mere infants in Christ.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?</p>

	<li>Read the story again. Have someone tell the story and ask the group to correct if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p>Though all Christians have the Spirit living in them, not all Christians are directed and empowered by the Spirit. When we trust in our own efforts or take control of our lives, the Bible calls us carnal and we don&rsquo;t experience an abundant or fruitful life. Read Galatians 5:22-24. We can use 3 circles to help us remember the 3 types of people described in 1 Corinthians (See Satisfied, The Christ-centred Life)</p>
