<h3>John Testifies Again About Jesus</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized.<sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>(This was before John was put in prison.)<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>An argument developed between some of John&rsquo;s disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>They came to John and said to him, &ldquo;Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan&mdash;the one you testified about&mdash;look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">John moved his ministry north of Judea to continue baptizing people on the edge of the regions of the Decapolis and Samaria. Meanwhile, Jesus continued his ministry in Judean countryside while John continued his ministry of preparing the way for people to come to Jesus. As John&rsquo;s disciples ask why Jesus&rsquo; ministry was growing bigger than John&rsquo;s, John explains his perspective: he knew who Jesus was and who he was. He knew that the source of real joy was being near Jesus and listening to His voice. John knew that after he heard Jesus speak he could only obey. John modeled dying to self and being obedient to the Father&rsquo;s will.</p>
