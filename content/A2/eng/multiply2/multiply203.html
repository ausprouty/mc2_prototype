<h3>The Magi Visit the Messiah</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>and asked, &ldquo;Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>When he had called together all the people&rsquo;s chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;In Bethlehem in Judea,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;for this is what the prophet has written:</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;<br />
for out of you will come a ruler<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who will shepherd my people Israel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>He sent them to Bethlehem and said, &ldquo;Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.</p>

<h3>The Escape to Egypt</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. &ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt,<sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: &ldquo;Out of Egypt I called my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;A voice is heard in Ramah,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weeping and great mourning,<br />
Rachel weeping for her children<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and refusing to be comforted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they are no more.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Jesus had a childhood just like you and me. He was recognized as a king by Gentile (non-Jewish) astrologers who gave gifts to the family. Jesus was also a refugee. Perhaps the gifts were used to help the family as they fled to Egypt to escape from King Herod. God continue to provide for the family as Jesus grew. When it was safe, God directed them back to their homeland.</p>
