<div class="bible_container">
<p class="reference">John 19:31- 20:31</p>
<!-- begin bible -->

<div class="bible">
<p><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.<sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.<sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus&rsquo; side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.<sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.<sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: &ldquo;Not one of his bones will be broken,&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>and, as another scripture says, &ldquo;They will look on the one they have pierced.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>The Burial of Jesus</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders. With Pilate&rsquo;s permission, he came and took the body away.<sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.<sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>Taking Jesus&rsquo; body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.<sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.<sup class="versenum">42&nbsp;</sup>Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.</p>

<h3>The Empty Tomb</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, &ldquo;They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don&rsquo;t know where they have put him!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.<sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.<sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.<sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus&rsquo; head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen.<sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>(They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.)<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Then the disciples went back to where they were staying.</p>

<h3>Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb<sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus&rsquo; body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>They asked her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you crying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have taken my Lord away,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know where they have put him.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>He asked her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thinking he was the gardener, she said, &ldquo;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, &ldquo;Rabboni!&rdquo; (which means &ldquo;Teacher&rdquo;).</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said, &ldquo;Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, &lsquo;I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: &ldquo;I have seen the Lord!&rdquo; And she told them that he had said these things to her.</p>

<h3>Jesus Appears to His Disciples</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &ldquo;Peace be with you!&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>Again Jesus said, &ldquo;Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>And with that he breathed on them and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.<sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>If you forgive anyone&rsquo;s sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Jesus Appears to Thomas</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>So the other disciples told him, &ldquo;We have seen the Lord!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he said to them, &ldquo;Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, &ldquo;Peace be with you!&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>Then he said to Thomas, &ldquo;Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>Thomas said to him, &ldquo;My Lord and my God!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus told him, &ldquo;Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>The Purpose of John&rsquo;s Gospel</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">He has risen from the dead! The Bible says that Jesus&rsquo; resurrection changes everything. &ldquo;Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; (Romans 6:8-11). The power to live life is in the power of Jesus&rsquo; victory over death. The resurrection of Jesus gives us power to defeat sin in our lives. The power of Jesus and His resurrection flows through us as we set aside our will and allow Jesus to live in and through us. Resurrection leadership is leadership that is allowing Jesus to live in and through us. Leading like Jesus is radically different than worldly leadership that seeks to promote itself and control others.<br />
