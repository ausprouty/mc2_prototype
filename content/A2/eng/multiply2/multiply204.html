<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Each year Jesus&rsquo; family would make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to celebrate Passover with family and friends. This year was special because at age 12, Jesus could ask questions and interact with the religious leaders of His day. Luke 2:40 summarizes Jesus&rsquo; boyhood until age 12. Luke 2:52 summarizes his growth toward manhood which covers the time at approximately age 18 until he was about 30.</p>
