<h3>The Word Became Flesh</h3>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Read Philippians 2:5-11. God almighty took on human form. He chose to begin as a baby and not as a grown man. The bible says that He &ldquo;made himself nothing&rdquo; and put on a body to live here with us. However, He never ceased to be fully God. He was still all-powerful, all-knowing, all-present. Yet He veiled or His deity and limited Himself and His powers to become a real human.</p>
