<div class="bible">
<div>
<p><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read,<sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is on me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because he has anointed me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to proclaim good news to the poor.<br />
He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and recovery of sight for the blind,<br />
to set the oppressed free,<br />
<sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to proclaim the year of the Lord&rsquo;s favor.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him.<sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>He began by saying to them, &ldquo;Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this Joseph&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; they asked.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Surely you will quote this proverb to me: &lsquo;Physician, heal yourself!&rsquo; And you will tell me, &lsquo;Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Truly I tell you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;no prophet is accepted in his hometown.<sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah&rsquo;s time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.<sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.<sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed&mdash;only Naaman the Syrian.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff.<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Jesus is back in Nazareth teaching in the local synagogue. These are people who would have known him and his family since he was a little boy. They wanted Jesus to perform a healing like He did for the royal official&rsquo;s son, but He knew they didn&rsquo;t believe in Him. They had no faith. At first everyone liked what Jesus was sharing. But then things changed when He started talking about God&rsquo;s global plan to be a blessing to non-Jewish people. In their prejudice, they took offense and rejected Jesus. Only as we live by faith will we see God do the impossible.</p>
