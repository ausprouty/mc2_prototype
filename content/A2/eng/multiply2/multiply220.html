<h3>Jesus Calls His First Disciples</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">1 </sup>One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, the people were crowding around him and listening to the word of God.<sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>He saw at the water&rsquo;s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.<sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, &ldquo;Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Simon answered, &ldquo;Master, we&rsquo;ve worked hard all night and haven&rsquo;t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.<sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus&rsquo; knees and said, &ldquo;Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken,<sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon&rsquo;s partners.</p>

<p>Then Jesus said to Simon, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid; from now on you will fish for people.&rdquo;<sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">Now Jesus is having an outreach in his team&rsquo;s workplace, Peter&rsquo;s own boat. He continues to provide on-the-job training to develop them as &ldquo;fishers of men&rdquo;. Jesus arrives early in the morning when people would have been coming to buy fresh fish from the night&rsquo;s catch. Jesus takes advantage of the opportunity to conduct an open-air outreach event. He doesn&rsquo;t try to assemble a big crowd, He just goes where the people are. He uses an already existing local event and turns it into an opportunity to do some of His own evangelism and training. It is interesting to see that Peter had returned to fishing. He was probably struggling with his commitment to follow Jesus in the mission. But Peter had a willing heart to obey Jesus. Jesus gave Peter another challenge. Peter accepts the challenge and leaves everything to follow Jesus full-time.</p>
