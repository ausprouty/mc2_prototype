  <p>
    <p>Jesus is our model for life and ministry. Because He is our model, it is important to know His character, His priorities, and His process for building a disciple-making movement. This movement multiplies others for fulfilling the Great Commission.</p>

<p>Christmas is the time we celebrate the mystery of The Word (John 1:1). The Word became fully human (John 1:14) born as a baby boy, Jesus of Nazareth. He came from eternity and entered into time and space. He entered a family, a culture, a village, a tribe and lived life one day at a time in first century Roman controlled Israel.</p>

<p>Though fully God, He chose to live His life as fully man, in total surrendered obedience to His heavenly Father. What He achieved in His life and ministry, He achieved as the man from Nazareth, the Son of Man, through the power and presence of the Holy Spirit in fulfilment of the Father&rsquo;s will. Though He had every right to operate out of his divinity, He chose to only live out of His perfect sinless humanity to be our example of how to fully glorify God in our life and ministry.</p>

<p>Jesus was and will always be fully God. Even though He had all the authority, power and resources of heaven at his command, He never used it. Instead He chose to &ldquo;become like his brothers in every way&rdquo; (Hebrews 2:17) but without sin. Because of this, the book of Hebrews encourages us, &ldquo;Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.&rdquo; (Hebrews 3:1)</p>

<p>The four Gospel writers record a summary of His life and teachings. By studying their written witness, we can learn about the development of His movement. In His humanity, even Jesus was subject to time and space and lived in the sequence of hours, days, weeks, years. He initiated and developed His movement in time. Therefore, Jesus&rsquo; case study is very instructive for leaders. We gain insight into how His life and movement unfolded over time by reconstructing a chronological sequence from the evidence provided by the Gospels.</p>

<p>Luke tells us that he sought to provide a well investigated and &ldquo;orderly account&rdquo; of Jesus life (Luke 1:1-4). The other writers were not concerned with order of events but arranged their accounts around themes. For example, John, the last of the four to write his gospel, recorded a lot of new material filling in some of the gaps in time especially the first year and a half (John 1-4) and the last few weeks (John 12-21) of Jesus earthly life and ministry. In fact, John 13-20 covers just three days!</p>

<p>The Gospel of Luke gives us some date markers so that we can locate Jesus in a historical context.</p>

<p>1Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, 2just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. &ndash; Luke 1:1-4.</p>

<p>Luke tells us that Jesus was born during the reign of King Herod [the Great] (Luke 1:5), during the reign of Caesar Augustus (Luke 2:1-7) and while Quirinius was governor of Syria (Luke 2:2). He also states Jesus started his ministry during the 15th reign of Tiberius Caesar (Luke 3:1-2) and that Jesus was about 30 years old when he started (Luke 3:21-23). This is important because it helps us learn more about when and how long Jesus did his ministry. We can begin to see steps he took to lay a foundation for disciple-making, develop his followers into disciple-makers and over time equip proven disciple-makers to become multiplying movement leaders.</p>
