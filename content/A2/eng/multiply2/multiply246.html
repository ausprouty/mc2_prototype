<h3>Jesus Comes to Jerusalem as King</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.<sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them,<sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.<sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>If anyone asks you, &lsquo;Why are you untying it?&rsquo; say, &lsquo;The Lord needs it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them.<sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, &ldquo;Why are you untying the colt?&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>They replied, &ldquo;The Lord needs it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.<sup class="versenum">36&nbsp;</sup>As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><sup class="versenum">39&nbsp;</sup>Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, &ldquo;Teacher, rebuke your disciples!&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it<sup class="versenum">42&nbsp;</sup>and said, &ldquo;If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace&mdash;but now it is hidden from your eyes.<sup class="versenum">43&nbsp;</sup>The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.<sup class="versenum">44&nbsp;</sup>They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God&rsquo;s coming to you.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Jesus at the Temple</h3>

<p><sup class="versenum">45&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out those who were selling.<sup class="versenum">46&nbsp;</sup>&ldquo;It is written,&rdquo; he said to them, &ldquo;&lsquo;My house will be a house of prayer&rsquo;; but you have made it &lsquo;a den of robbers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><sup class="versenum">47&nbsp;</sup>Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him.<sup class="versenum">48&nbsp;</sup>Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words.</p>

<h2 class="up">Summary</h2>

<p class="up">A prophecy given 500 years earlier is fulfilled before these young leaders&rsquo; eyes. A king riding on a donkey will approach Jerusalem! (Zechariah 9:9). People were praising God as Jesus descended down the Mount of Olives on the road into the city of Jerusalem. The Pharisees understood the Messianic implications of the situation and told Jesus to tell His disciples to be quiet. But Jesus knew the importance that this testimony played in the Father&rsquo;s plan. As Jesus approaches the city, He begins to weep. Jesus was grieved because He knew most of the people did not realize who He was or the significance of this event. He also knew that one day judgement would come on the city because of their unbelief; Jerusalem would be destroyed by the Roman army. Once again, we see Jesus&rsquo; passion displayed as he drives out the money changers who had returned to their old practices, taking advantage of people coming to worship God. Jesus not only showed passion for the Father&rsquo;s reputation, but compassion for the poor and the foreigner.</p>
