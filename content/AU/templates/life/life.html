      <p>
        <sup>19</sup>“Do not store up for yourselves treasures
        on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and
        steal.<sup >20</sup>But store up for
        yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy,
        and where thieves do not break in and steal.<sup
          
          >21</sup
        >For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >22</sup>“The eye is the lamp of the
        body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of
        light.<sup >23</sup>But if your eyes are
        unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light
        within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >24</sup>“No one can serve two masters.
        Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted
        to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >25</sup>“Therefore I tell you, do not
        worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body,
        what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than
        clothes?<sup >26</sup>Look at the birds of the
        air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your
        heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than
        they?<sup >27</sup>Can any one of you by
        worrying add a single hour to your life?
      </p>
      <p>
        <sup >28</sup>“And why do you worry about
        clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or
        spin.<sup >29</sup>Yet I tell you that not
        even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.<sup
          
          >30</sup
        >If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today
        and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe
        you—you of little faith?<sup >31</sup>So do
        not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or
        ‘What shall we wear?’<sup >32</sup>For the
        pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that
        you need them.<sup >33</sup>But seek first his
        kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you
        as well.
